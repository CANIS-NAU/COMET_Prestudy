There are 4 sites in Denver: den02, den04, den05, den06. Do you happen to know which of those the suspect tests are running against? If you are using the Locate Service for testing (which you probably are), then your tests should be running to one of those sites somewhat randomly.  Each site has 3 production machines: mlab1, mlab2, mlab3. If you are testing from a browser, then you should be able to determine which site and machine is being tested against by looking at either the javascript console, or by looking at network connections.  At a glance, everything at the Denver sites is healthy and average throughput on the switches is very far below each site\'s capacity. Over the past 6 hours I\'m only seeing roughly 200-300Mbit/s on the interfaces, and these sites are all connected on 10Gbit/s uplinks.

The sites are as follows:  den02: Lumen (Level3) den04: Zayo den05: Telia den06: GTT  I would be very surprised to find out that, for any given client, performance would differ between any of the machines at a given site. It would not surprise me, however, if performance differed (possibly substantially) between any of the sites. My best guess would be poor peering between the client\'s ISP and one of the transit providers we use in Denver.  The first step will be to find out to which of those providers the users are seeing very poor performance. Once you\'ve found the problematic transit provider on the M-Lab side, the next step would be to have the client run some traceroutes to one of the machines at the impacted M-Lab site. If it does indeed turn out that the issue is poor peering, then someone could perhaps reach out to the ISP to let them know of the issue, and to see if there anything the ISP can do about. For small ISPs, there may not be much they can do, likely because of a monetary constraint.  For an ndt7 test, there is no easy way to force the test to a particular server. For ndt5, someone could run a client locally, and specify the exact server. For now, you could perhaps have any user reporting these disparities run traceroutes to one machine at each M-Lab site in Denver, looking for any that might have a suboptimal or long path.

My connection does seem slow.   Thaks for any insight you can provide,  Regards, Paul Zahra	"{0: {'username': 'Lai Yi Ohlsen', 'response_date': 'Apr 13, 2022, 3:15:43 PM', 'response_content': 'Hi Paul,   Thanks for your question. The simplest way to answer, is that M-Labâs NDT and Ooklaâs SpeedTest measure fundamentally different things. They differ in three key ways: 1. M-Lab measures to servers in off-net locations, Ookla measures to on-net locations. 2. NDT measures bulk transport capacity, SpeedTest attempts to measure link capacity and 3. NDT is a single stream test, SpeedTest is a multi-stream  Here is a more in depth explanation of each characteristic:  1. Off-net vs. on-net measurement: All of M-Labâs measurement services, including NDT, are hosted on our off-net platform. âOn-netâ refers to measurements performed on the same network as the network it is measuring, such as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) measuring itself. It only captures one segment of any path that data is likely to be traversing. In contrast, âoff-netâ measurements extend beyond a userâs access providerâs network to measure the complete path across the Internet from user to content including interconnections. By definition, on-net measurement can not even detect the effects of any performance limitations at interconnects between ISPs. All of the measurement services hosted by M-Lab inherit the off-net platform methodology for nearly all users. 2. Link capacity vs. bulk transport: When using NDT tests specifically, Internet users are sometimes confused when their individual results donât confirm the speeds promised by their Internet service provider. âSpeedâ is often associated with âlink capacity,â which is the maximum bitrate of a link; in other words, the best performance possible. However, NDT measures âbulk transport capacityâ â the rate that TCP can deliver data across the end-to-end path; in other words, the reliability of that connection. It is important to note that many link problems (such as low level packet loss and reordering) typically adversely impact both MLab measurements and real application performance.  These two ways of measuring performance, link capacity and bulk transport capacity, are different and are often conflated when both concepts are referred to as âInternet speed.â When using NDT data to discuss speed, it is important to clarify these terms to have more effective conversations about Internet speed. 3. Single-stream vs. multi-stream tests: NDT measures the single-stream performance of bulk transport capacity. While modern web browsers will use multiple streams of data, testing for multiple streams can compensate for data delivery problems that are exposed by a single stream. A multi-stream test can return measurements closer to link capacity but it would not represent the adverse performance impact of low-level packet loss. By testing for single-stream performance, NDT is an effective baseline for measuring a userâs Internet performance.  In short, NDT does not answer the question âhow big is your pipeâ but rather âhow well is your pipe transferring data.â We consider both metrics to be important for understanding connectivity. For more reading, you can reference How fast is my Internet? Speed Tests, Accuracy, NDT & M-Lab which digs more into the definition of âspeedâ and NDT Data in NTIA Indicators of Broadband Need, which though focuses on the US federal mapping resource, helps describe the difference between the aggregated datasets for the purpose of research.  Additionally, any given test result is impacted by a number of factors, including the network management and topology of the path, the traffic on the network at the time of the test, and other environmental factors. One of the reasons M-Lab finds it so important to publish this data openly, is so we can study these factors in a more statistically rigorous way as part of a sample vs. in the one-off context of individual tests.   I hope this answer addresses your question, but please let me know if I can explain anything further.   \ue5d3 \ue5d3 -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups ""discuss"" group.

M-Lab would actually be assisting the research community by removing this misinformation, rather than simply issuing disclaiming caveats. As Sara Wedeman and David Clark noted in their paper, ""In short, NDT was a diagnostic tool, not a measuring stick. The purpose was not to evaluate or compare residential broadband speeds delivered by ISPs, but rather to find and fix network problems."" At another point they observed: ""Our high-level conclusions {are} that these are not tests that reveal variation in the access technology, and computing a mean or median of these measurements will tell us nothing about the speed of the access link."" And finally, Wedeman and Clark also observe: ""The data from M-Lab is free and publicly available - and despite M-Labâs cautionary messages on its Web site, M-Lab data can be, and has been used inappropriately on more than one occasion.""

Before declaring that MLab is not a speed test, first you have to have agreement as to what a speed test is.  A speed test measures something.  That something has a context usually related to usability for a purpose.  If the purpose is to determine the size of the pipe maybe MLab isn't the best choice.  If the purpose is to determine if a specific task can be accomplished, maybe Mlab is the best choice.  There is a clear difference on the type of speed test to be used if:  1.  you want to know if you can stream Netflix 4k videos without buffering  2.  If Johnny can get responses to his homework answers in less than 3 seconds.  3.  If you can hold a video conference call on a service that has single port streaming.  I'm sure there are other answers, but it depends on what purpose you have in mind when you declare a speed test adequate, or not, for that purpose.  Let me point out that our dear friends at the FCC built Mlab into their mobil speed test, and further point out that their own research subsequently declared that MLab was a more than adequate test for their purposes in a way that was acceptable, albeit different, from Ookla, which was also acceptable.      \ue5d3 \ue5d3 To view this discussion on the web visit https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/d/msgid/discuss/fdf7d530-20f0-41b4-b136-59b26ba45de2n%40measurementlab.net.""}, 6: {'username': 'Ethan Katz-Bassett', 'response_date': 'Apr 14, 2022, 5:26:28 PM', 'response_content': 'I think this is a great summary of key differences!   However, as an additional caveat in interpreting the data, it\'s not clear to me what off-net vs on-net measurements meaningfully represent in terms of ""the complete path across the Internet from user to content."" For many (probably most) Internet users, much (probably most) of their traffic comes either from an on-net Content Delivery Network (CDN) node or across a dedicated network interconnection to the content provider. So it\'s not clear to me that traffic crossing one or a few particular network interconnections between me and the assigned MLab server is a more meaningful measure of the performance I\'d get to content than a measurement to an on-net server -- I suspect that neither exercises any interdomain interconnections that my traffic encounters when using YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, services hosted on the major cloud providers, services hosted on a number of widely-used CDNs, etc. If the NDT measurement is constrained by issues at the interconnection, the issues could apply to any services I use that happen to share that interconnection, but that\'s probably not the case for most services I use, and it requires a good amount of Internet measurement to understand which ones do share it.

All of these tests are subject to severe sampling bias, particular under-representation of samples in communities where connectivity gaps are most dire.  This I believe is a fundamental issue that is common across *all* of todayâs methodologies. Client-based tests face severe sampling limitations; even the MBA program stratifies its sample by ISP and thereby severely undersamples most geographies, making it not very useful for many types of studies.  See our TPRC paper for some initial discussion of these issues: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3786158  2. All of these tests are subject to various issues with client-based measurements, from WiFi bottlenecks to limitations of the radios on (old) client devices. A particular issue we discovered at one point was that many NDT tests on higher speed links were being performed from old iPhones whose radios did not support speeds of greater than 100 Mbps. In short, the NDT test was measuring the radio of the mobile device, not the ISP. See our CACM paper for more discussion on that. https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3372135  3. I am not sure it is accurate to say that NDT answers the question of âhow well is you pipe transferring dataâ. A more precise statement would be that it measures the transfer rate across a single transport connectionâat one point a fairly outmoded version of TCP, and now a single BBR stream.  And so it might represent how well the connection transfers data across that transport, but itâs also worth pointing out that no modern application that seeks to maximize capacity relies on a single transport connectionâeverything from browsers to streaming clients on smart TVs use multiple parallel connections (some do so in rather extreme fashion, but thatâs another topic).  4. Off-net measurements have their own caveats. One notable oneâwhich came to light in none other than an M-Lab report!âwas that as a result of an end-to-end path to an off-net server that crossed Cogent, the report mis-diagnosed the location of congestion (and its resolution).  Cogentâs CEO also acknowledged this particular issue (read my FCC filing on the issue for more about that: https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/file/download/DOC-578d040705800000-A.pdf).  5. To the point about the Google search âone boxââcharacterizing the loss of NDT measurements as a âgreat loss to the research communityâ presumes that âmore data is betterâ and âopen data is better""âindependent of the *quality* of those measurements.  But, Iâd argue we need to rethink that. As Jim and Jason have both pointed out, the data has been actively misused and mischaracterized over many yearsâand this continues to happen. Part of the reason I believe this to be the case is the reason Lai Yi mentions: there are âso few alternativesâ.  Itâs time to change that because regardless of the facts, people will take the path of least resistance. Casting it in the most charitable lightâwhile some stakeholders may be willfully misrepresenting the data, I suspect others simply donât have the time or interest in understanding the nuance that this group is familiar with. Taking shortcuts like that is sloppy and unscientificâsomething that has bothered me for quite some timeâbut I think some groups have gotten away with it because thereâs little denying that there *are* gaps in infrastructure, connectivity, etc.ânevermind that the data itself doesnât actually tell you much about the specific nature of any particular problem, people are happy to talk in broad strokes and handwave if the data conveniently speaks to an agenda. But now, as we think about actually *solving* problems, this becomes a more serious problemâthe existing tools and methodsâmeasurement techniques, data, sampling approachesâdo very little in helping anyone actually work towards fixing these problems.  I believe thatâs where we should be turning our focus in the next 5-10 years. \ue5d3'}, 8: {'username': 'Lai Yi Ohlsen', 'response_date': 'Apr 15, 2022, 6:41:23 AM', 'response_content': ""Hi everyone,  Thank you all for your thoughtful notes.

We currently collect the clientâs IP address as a means of identifying each individual data point, but are considering alternatives that could potentially improve the elusive equilibrium of privacy and usability. While we are in the Design Phase, the M-Lab team would like to consult with the users of our data, to better understand what the requirements of this effort ought to include. More specifically, we will ask: what do you use the IP address for when using the data? How well would the proposed alternatives work for these use cases?   If you canât make it, but want to provide feedback, the session will be recorded. If you can attend though, please do, so we can engage in an active group dialogue as much as possible.   To RSVP: - If you have previously RSVPâd to our community calls, you should have already received a calendar invite with a Zoom link included.

The different behavior seems to be caused by nodejs\' implementation of WebSockets (specifically, the ""ws"" library that is used to provide WebSocket support in nodejs).                         TL;DR: always use the server-side throughput since it is based on how much data the server has received at the end of the upload measurement and is not affected by WebSocket implementation quirks.  Take the following with a grain of salt as I\'m not an expert in nodejs internals by any means, but here\'s a possible explanation for what you are observing:  The application-level rate (""goodput"" in the client\'s output) is computed as (bytes_sent - bytes_in_buffer) / elapsed_time * 8. While the client knows exactly how many bytes it tried to send (bytes_sent), to determine bytes_in_buffer we rely on the bufferedAmount property of the WebSocket object. The nodejs WebSocket library includes both the WebSocket frame bytes (~10B per frame) and some internal net.Socket buffer in bufferedAmount, potentially causing the bytes_in_buffer to be overestimated and report some data already sent as still in the buffer. This, in turn, causes the computed rate to be lower.  The server-side throughput (based on the last TCPInfo snapshot from the server) is computed as TCPInfo.BytesReceived / TCPInfo.ElapsedTime * 8. It includes TCP/WebSocket/TLS overheads, provides the most accurate rate regardless of the client, and should be used to show the result to the user instead of MeanClientMbps.  I have recently updated our examples to only show the server-side throughput (https://github.com/m-lab/ndt7-js/blob/main/examples/node-client.js#L30) Hope this helps!  -Roberto  \ue5d3 \ue5d3 -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups ""discuss"" group.

Tcpdump reveals significant tcp zero windows during the NDT session.  The server host is running BBR with appropriately tuned stack variables (proven by iperf3 tests).    Are there any known limitations for 10Gbps link speeds?  Any hints for tuning or places to investigate further?

When a measurement exceeding 2.5Gbps is detected, the server won\'t accept new measurements until that one is complete, to preserve the measurement quality, essentially implementing the ""one client at a time"" policy for a limited time. Clients should move on to the next server provided by the Locate load balancer in case one of them becomes temporarily unavailable due to this.

(You can\'t tell when a test starts if it needs a dedicated server.)  Today we see a few tests per day at rates  in excess of 1Gb/s, and some minority of these tests cause congestion within our infrastructure and affect other measurements.  In aggregate across the entire fleet (~500 servers) we see a few congested seconds per day.  But there is a deeper problem.  I am not aware of any consumer grade applications* that actually need more than about 100 Mb/s.   The race for more speed is a  stunt (""mine is bigger!"" and ""we have to keep up"") by the marketing departments at all ISPs and are universally hated^H^H^H^H dreaded by the engineering team at the same ISPs.  What is actually happening is there are other problems in the network (typically queuing issues) that cause application stalls unrelated to raw throughput.  The current situation is sort of analogous to fixing the flat tire by upgrading the engine to 5,000 HP.  The mechanic installing the new engine has to beef up the rest of the drivetrain and along the way might accidentally fix the root problem.  But in any case the (new) tires don\'t have enough traction to do anything useful with 5k HP, so the car doesn\'t actually go any faster than the original design (which might indeed be faster than driving on flats).  We (the network testing community) are part of the problem, because we routinely publish performance numbers that are so high that they are not relevant.   This is why we are pivoting to do better diagnosis, so we can help people fix the right problem.  We need to stop wasting vast resources fixing the wrong problem.  I have often toyed with the idea of somehow redacting all results above some threshold (200 Mb/s?) in an attempt to reduce the insanity, but we too are part of an irrelevant race to an irrelevant goal.  *The only exception would be people trying to run commercial grade services on consumer grade connectivity.  Our tools aren\'t designed for them.

I am retired and do volunteer work.  I have sent large ""pro video"" source files up to file sharing services to be transferred to editors.    GOOGLE DRIVE allows sustained upload at over 500Mbps, which really cuts down on the wait time.  10GiByte file uploads complete in a few minutes. (It would be nice to be faster, but the bottleneck appears to be at GoogleDrive or Google\'s PI with the ISP).   Mlab and other speed test measurements inform that finger pointing.)  In the LA area, there are many folks who produce and edit from home (for a living), and need to upload and download large files. While folks in LA (and other pro content creation hubs) are shooting with professional camera gear, consumer generation of large video files may become more common as higher image fidelity creation is supported on mobile devices. (Apple sponsors its ""Shot on iPhone"" program.  And other device manufacturers, including Google, are including improved camera sensors in their phones.  I\'ve seen ""shot on iphone"" short films run at film festivals.  Submittal to the festival was by online upload.)  Velma does clinical monitoring of advanced cancer treatments.  While she travels to research centers, she does have a home office and accesses some resources remotely from time to time.  I understand from her and the media that remote-reading of medical imaging occurs frequently.  (The radiologist that evaluates a given test may be in another state or country.)   As the imaging resolutions improve, transferred files will get larger.  (Detail counts when looking for lesions.)  We repeatedly hear that there is a  groundswell of employee support for ""work from home"".   High performance FTTH implementations make that increasingly feasible.  MLAB testing can ensure that the promises of FTTH providers are actually delivered. Disparaging high performance seems like the old ""no one will need more than 640k"" mantra. I prefer ""if you build it they will come"".    I certainly enjoy being able to download OS patches and new SW ""quasi-instantaneously"".  Indeed, downloads are so fast now that when a CDN errantly serves you from sub-optimal source (say one half-way around the globe in Europe) the degradation is readily apparent.  When Velma\'s company\'s IT staff first deployed a remote update to her (then new) machine, they called her and told her they suspected it was not working correctly, as it completed so quickly.  (At the time she had one of the newest machines in her company.  It is M.2 based, and she is GigE attached to the home LAN, with Gig FTTH ISP service.)  Windows-11 will force a lot of folks to replace their legacy PCs.  A whole lot of folks will be getting their hands on newer machines, many will be built upon M.2 NVMe.   This will remove yet another layer of performance impediment from the consumer-grade user. Ditto for migrations to wifi-6E mesh systems, and mm-wave 5G for mobile devices (at least in good signal areas).  I think Mlab and the other test services can continue to add value, even as consumer last-mile bottlenecks are removed (albeit at a seeming glacial pace with some ISPs).

You are correct, we could raise our performance ceiling.   I first started working on Internet performance at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in 1990.   That year, I was trying to get PSC -> SDSC to run faster than 5 Mb/s.  For many years, my day job was ""TCP tuning"", and every few years we would fix one global problem, but then have a new goal and a new set of problems to debug and deploy.  Yes we could raise MLab\'s target performance to 10 Gb/s.  Improving our  tools is probably doable, but upgrading our fleet would be problematic.  However, today I worry far more about the other end of the spectrum.    I fear there are several billion of people (including millions of Americans) who don\'t have sufficient Internet to do basic things that the rest of us now take for granted.    We do not know if MLab tools get reliable measurements below 1 Mb/s, and that means we can\'t effectively measure Internet coverage for a huge number of people.  We do know that some of the optimizations that are likely to help the high end have the potential to hurt measurements at the low end (specifically larger buffers).

25	traceroute-rfc---request-for-feedback-by-end-of-january	1642550261.0	2022-01-18 16:57:41	Lai Yi Ohlsen	Hi everyone,   M-Lab has published an RFC discussing our transition from MDA traceroute data. If you use our traceroute dataset or plan to in the future, please take a look at the RFC and send us your feedback by the end of January. Excerpt below.   ----  Background M-Labâs traceroute-caller (TRC) tool was designed and developed in early 2019 as a sidecar service running on M-Lab servers. Its purpose is to collect traceroute data to any remote IP address after it closes its TCP connection to an M-Lab server. TRC uses the scamper tool for running traceroutes.   The initial version of TRC called scamper to run the tracelb command and saved the resulting traceroute as traceroute datatype which was renamed to scamper1 datatype.  As described in scamperâs manual page, the tracelb command is used to infer all per-flow load-balanced paths between a source and destination using the Multipath Discovery Algorithm (MDA). Starting in 1Q22, TRC also supports regular traceroutes which take much less time to run and return a simpler result that is saved as scamper2 datatype.  M-Lab would like to start collecting regular traceroutes (in addition to MDA traceroutes) in 1Q22 and stop collecting MDA traceroutes by the end of 2Q22.  Request for Comments We are publishing this RFC to get feedback from the community regarding our decision to stop running MDA traceroutes by the end of 2Q22 and, instead, run regular traceroutes with the Paris traceroute algorithm.  If you use MDA traceroutes (scamper1 datatype) and this decision impacts you, please let us know via reply to the dis...@measurementlab.net mailing list. Also, please let us know if you are planning research that would benefit from regular traceroutes (scamper2 datatype).  Based on your feedback, we will decide if we need to continue running MDA traceroutes and how to support it beyond what we already have.  Read the full RFC on our website.  Thanks! Happy New Year.   -- Lai Yi Ohlsen Director, Measurement Lab Code for Science & Society	"{0: {'username': 'Timur Friedman', 'response_date': 'Jan 19, 2022, 12:39:26 PM', 'response_content': 'Hello Lai Yi,  Am I correct in understanding that two things motivate this change?  - The complexity of parsing the multipath traceroute data structure - The time that it takes to run the MDA in order to collect a multipath traceroute  If so, there are alternatives to abandoning the collection of multipath traceroutes. After all, M-Lab has the largest set of multipath traceroutes (well over one billion!) going back over many years. Anyone who wants to study how multipath routing has evolved over time in the internet would be hard-pressed to find any other comparable dataset.  Regarding the complex data structure, a single-path traceroute could easily be extracted from a multipath traceroute via post-processing. It would not be necessary to conduct the measurement twice.  And regarding the time that it takes, the problem has been solved in Kevin Vermeulen\'s Diamond-Miner work.  https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/vermeulen  While Kevin\'s work focuses on rapidly collecting traceroutes towards all of the internet\'s routable prefixes in a short period of time, the principles behind the speed-up apply equally well to a trace towards a single destination. In a first round of probing, packets to all hop-counts can be sent in parallel, and ten rounds of probing are almost always enough to complete a multipath traceroute, meaning the time required is slightly less than the time required for a classic traceroute, which has a time requirement that scales with the length of the route.  We\'ve distilled the Diamond-Miner probing engine into free open-source liberally licensed code that we call Caracal.  https://github.com/dioptra-io/caracal  With Caracal, we could easily speed up M-Lab\'s multipath route tracing while producing both multipath and single path outputs in the existing formats that M-Lab provides.  Incidentally, we are producing daily surveys from a single vantage point of multipath traceroutes to all routable IPv4 prefixes in the internet, and these are available to any researcher upon request through our Iris platform.  https://iris.dioptra.io/#/  So if M-Lab continues to collect multipath traceroutes, it will no longer be alone in doing so, which should enhance the value of M-Lab\'s multipath data for the research community.

Multipath routing is one of those things like MPLS tunnels and IP anycast that reflect ongoing fundamental changes in how things work in the internet. To me, it would be a pity to see a break in this key dataset that allows people in the future to study how this particular architectural aspect of the network has evolved.  In order to extract a single-path traceroute, one simply needs to focus on a single flow identifier, what the RIPE Atlas folks call the ""Paris ID"", and pick out the interface at each hop that corresponds to that identifier in the multipath traceroute.  There are some implementation details to be addressed, such as what happens in the rare case that a per-packet load balancer is traversed, and the same Paris ID returns multiple interfaces at the same hop; or which path to prefer if one is longer than another, or has a better response rate from interfaces than another. So long as the design decisions are well documented, I do not see any fundamental difficulties.  Users would not need to do this processing themselves if it were provided as a post-processed output from the multipath traceroute tool itself. The tool could provide both the multipath traceroute and an example single-path traceroute corresponding to a single Paris ID.

This strikes me as an implementation issue that could be addressed by tweaking the current tracing tool.  It is possible to design a route tracing tool so that classic Traceroute\'s demultiplexing issue goes away.   The original insight was Rob Beverly\'s: to craft the traceroute probe packets in such a way that the ICMP replies are entirely self-identifying. This does away with the need to maintain state on each probe packet sent, in order to match each reply with its corresponding probe packet. He based his high-speed single-path probing tool Yarrp on this insight.  Kevin Vermeulen extended the same principle to multipath probing: his Diamond-Miner tool similarly crafts the probe packets so that the ICMP replies are self-identifying, including, in this case, the flow identifiers, or ""Paris IDs"", of each probe packet that provoked a reply.  Now, our Iris measurement platform regularly runs Diamond-Miner route traces towards all routable IPv4 prefixes of the internet at a rate of 100,000 probe packets per second. Under these conditions, there are hundreds of thousands of outstanding probe packets at any given moment, and when the replies do come in, they are successfully associated with the trace of a particular route or, occasionally, if the reply is corrupted in some way, discarded.  The 100,000 probe packet per second limit is self-imposed so as not to trigger warnings with our ISP. Otherwise, Diamond-Miner could be scaled to run faster, say at a million probe packets per second or more, while all the time correctly identifying the replies.  We have embodied this behavior in our liberally-licensed free open-source Caracal probing engine. As I mentioned, earlier in this thread, we could easily provide the route tracing tool that M-Lab needs on the basis of this engine. It would be sure to obtain a single-path route trace alongside each multipath trace. And it would withstand whatever case load you send its way. I\'m including Maxime Mouchet, the lead developer and maintainer of the current version of Caracal, in the conversation.

The multipath measurements can be in a separate table for those who want them, perhaps with a foreign key to join between the two.  Our most common use case has been when we are working on something related to Internet routing/measurement and need a large set of multipath routes or load balancing routers, to help us test the behavior of our measurements in that setting or to help us interpret those results. It\'s useful to have large sets of such measurements already available (from Timur\'s platform and/or M-Lab) that we can easily use to join with our measurements.

As the FCC prepares to kick off a comment period around broadband disclosure labels and what to include in them to better inform US consumers[1], I'm interested in what ideas have been floated in this community around the topic of broadband performance.  I noticed some community calls have touched on the issue and I'm curious if the recordings get posted anywhere.  Also, if anyone knows of any additional resources (papers, talks, webinars, people, etc) around communicating quality of service/quality of experience metrics to consumers and can point me to them, I'd appreciate it!

Thank you for starting this conversation, I\'m looking forward to hearing the community\'s thoughts on the topic.   Regarding our community call recordings -- we did not record the calls at first in an effort to keep things casual, but did begin to record in August 2021. Here\'s the video of Latency, Bufferbloat and Responsiveness with Matt Mathis, Christophe Paasch and Dave Taht, who discussed metrics for broadband performance alternative to bandwidth (which some feel has been overemphasized/optimized for). And more recently, Dave Clark and Sara Wedeman from MIT discussed their paper Measurement, Meaning and Purpose which explored the M-Lab NDT dataset and its ability to assess broadband performance. The video of that call has not been uploaded yet, but I will post to this discuss@ list when it has.    From an academic, network research perspective, you might find the papers of the recent IAB workshop on Network Quality interesting and relevant. The summary of that event is quite useful. And from a digital inclusion perspective, you might be interested in joining the Marconi Society-led Broadband Mapping Coalition, a network of orgs advocating for the use of open data in broadband planning.   For M-Lab data specifically, we\'ve written a set of best practices to help guide the use of our data in broadband advocacy and policy work. We\'ve also written a guide to NTIA\'s Indicators of Broadband Need map for researchers trying to make sense of the similar but quite different methodologies that the map draws upon. More broadly, as the national conversation around broadband performance continues to unfold, M-Lab will continue to be a resource by providing open Internet performance data and aim to adapt that resource as needed. Whether that\'s in new analyses of our current data or additions to the measurements that we host, we\'ll be listening for feedback about how we can best contribute.

Thanks so much for all the reading material suggestions, I will do my best to read through it all.  -Marina \ue5d3""}}"

Writing to share some M-Lab updates from the months of June and July.   Blog posts M-Lab's Murakami Tool - Supporting Structured Research Data Collection from the User Perspective discusses the work of the MIRA project, a joint initiative of Internet Society and AFRINIC, and their use of Murakami, an open source tool which offers three key features: a method for collecting standardized data; automatic, recurring measurements; and support for multiple measurement methodologies. Read more if you'd like to use Murakami in your research or help develop the tool in the future. Thank you to the MIRA team for your collaboration and IMLS for the project's initial support.    NDT Data in NTIA Indicators of Broadband Need is a follow-up to the release of the NTIA Indicators of Broadband Need, a needed and welcome contribution to US broadband mapping. In this blog post, we discuss the inclusion of data from our Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) in the NTIA map and dig into the detail of each dataset provided in the Indicators of Broadband Need map. The post gives readers a deeper understanding of the differences and context to the various datasets in the NTIA Indicators of Broadband Need Map, as well as our understanding of how each relates to the 25/3 national broadband standard. Thanks to NTIA for including M-Lab data in the map as well as Benton Institute for including our article in your newsletter.   And on June 29th, 2021 we published an update about recent developments to ndt7, including fixes for Safari and Firefox integrations and more. Thank you to all the community contributors who helped with the core contribution team with these updates.   Community Calls According to the schedule we released at the beginning of the year, we are scheduled to host an Internet Research call next week on Wednesday, July 28th, 2021. This call will be rescheduled to a date TBA. As with all our calls, it will take place on a Wednesday at 11am Eastern. If you have received invites to previous calls, you will receive an invite once it is scheduled. If you have not already RSVP'd to our calls, you can do so here.   That's all for now -- have a great weekend! Talk to you soon when I inevitably remember other updates I forgot to put in this email. As always feel free to reach out with any questions, either to the list or me directly.   -- Lai Yi Ohlsen Director, Measurement Lab Code for Science & Society	"{0: {'username': 'Glenn Fishbine', 'response_date': 'Jan 12, 2022, 9:17:44 AM', 'response_content': 'Possible re-emerging iPhone issue.

However, I see that traceroutes from only up until 09/2021 are available on the cloud storage (screenshot attached). Is the latest traceroute data not published yet or am I looking in the wrong place?   Moreover, what's the publishing frequency for traceroute data?

First, I'll note that there are multiple locations for traceroute data in GCS, which represent traces for connections to the various measurement services that M-Lab provides, as well as for connections to the host servers themselves. These are documented on the traceroute page on our website. The screenshot you shared refers to the traces for connections to our host servers.  Beginning in 09/2021, the M-Lab engineering team began publishing a new traceroute datatype, scamper1, replacing the previous datatype, traceroute. The raw traces for scamper1 can be found in: gs://archive-measurement-lab/host/scamper1 - traces to IPs connecting to our host servers gs://archive-measurement-lab/ndt/scamper1 - traces to IPs connecting to the NDT measurement service gs://archive-measurement-lab/neubot/scamper1 - traces to IPs connecting to the Neubot DASH measurement service Regarding publication frequency, traces in all of the buckets listed here should be available at least up to the day prior to today, and is published on an ongoing basis. So there are likely traces collected today in these buckets as well.  Processed traces are also available in BigQuery for the NDT measurement service, with one day overlap between the traceroute and scamper1 datatypes: For traces to IPs connecting to the NDT service prior to and including 2021-09-09, see: measurement-lab.ndt.traceroute For traces from 2021-09-08 to present, see: measurement-lab.ndt_raw.scamper1 I hope this is helpful, but if there are additional questions, of course let us know.

We are starting to notice a couple of interesting things:  - Some repeated speed tests have wildly varying upload speeds.  One data block that we're observing ran the same speed test 21 time in a row, and reported 5 data points ~1 Mbps and 12 data points over 1 Gbps.  The download speeds did not vary between any of these runs (held steady between 9-10 Mbps).  The user is on DSL and was using an iPhone and mobile browser to run the test.  We were able to replicate it using an iPhone as well.  - We are also noticing duplicate results that are spaced less than 10 seconds apart.  All result values are identical except for the timestamp.  We don't think it's a user running back-to-back tests because it takes ~20 seconds to complete a test.

At TPRC 2021, Dave Clark and Sare Wedeman presented âMeasurement, Meaning and Purpose: Exploring the NDT Datasetâ which raises relevant and timely questions about M-Labâs NDT dataset and its potential applications. Please join us for a presentation from the authors and a discussion with the M-Lab community.    Abstract The speed of a data transfer over the Internet connection is a measure of great interest. It can directly influence quality of experience, it can serve as a measure of equitable access, and it can reveal whether or not the speed matches that which was advertised. One of earliest and longest-standing tools to contain a speed test is the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT), currently supported by Measurement Lab (M-Lab). NDT, in its various forms, has been used across the globe since 2003. There are billions of measurements archived by M-Lab, with a rich collection of metadata for each measurement. This data allows an in-depth analysis of each measurement, and potentially supports analysis across aggregates of measurements.  The original purpose of NDT was diagnostic: why is my connection operating as it is? However, the archive of this data invites its use in aggregate form to draw conclusions about the overall behavior of the Internet. Such use, however, is confounded by the fact that the individual measurements are triggered by users for a range of reasons: simple curiosity, debugging, anger, bragging rights, or automated checking of operational status (in some cases as often as once a minute). NDT measures network speed, but it equally - if indirectly - measures human behavior.  The goals of this paper are to explore the archived NDT data in order to provide insights about how it can be interpreted; and to distinguish between appropriate uses of the data from uses that may lead to unwarranted conclusions.   Dave Clark, Senior Research Scientist at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory David Clark is a Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Since the mid-70s, he has played a leading role in the development of the Internet; from 1981-1989 he acted as Chief Protocol Architect, and chaired the Internet Activities Board. His recent research has focused on the re-definition of the architectural underpinnings of the Internet and the relation of technology and architecture to economic, societal and policy considerations. Specific research areas include Internet security and Internet measurement.  Sara Wedeman, Senior Collaborating Researcher at MITâs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.   Sara Wedeman is a Senior Collaborating Researcher at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. With a background in psychology, measurement, and technology, she held senior management positions in Banking and Consulting, before founding, in 2003, one of the first  firms to focus explicitly on the practical application of Behavioral Economics. Sara has been working with computers since 1984 and is expert at conducting action research in technology and the behavioral/social sciences, using advanced data analytics to uncover actionable results. She has over 25 years' experience in Consulting, having brought empirically-based guidance to technology and  financial services companies, academic institutions, and others - including the NTIA's Broadband Measurement program.

43	renaming-ndt-datasets-and-views-in-bigquery	1617599826.0	2021-04-04 22:17:06	Matt Mathis	We are reorganizing our NDT datasets and views to make them easier to find and navigate. The new datasets and views will be created on Wednesday, Apr 7th, including updating the documentation to match.   There are no schema changes in this update, but all dataset and view  names are changing.   Newly named datasets and views will be published on Wednesday, April 7th, and the following Wednesday, April 14th, old datasets and views will be deleted.  Please update your queries to use the new names as soon as possible.  This update also includes some minor bug fixes, that should not affect any properly functioning user queries: some web100 queries that were causing BigQuery exceptions incorrect congestion control algorithms were being reported for upload tests a small amount of pre-production data that was collected on mlab4 nodes (0.1%)  during early platform migration will be suppressed from production data.  Updated documentation on all newly named datasets and views will be published at:  https://www.measurementlab.net/tests/ndt/ on Wednesday.  Summary of new NDT datasets and views:  Unified Views (only bug fixes): measurement-lab.ndt.unified_downloads measurement-lab.ndt.unified_uploads  Dataset Renaming This update will change the name of two NDT datasets:  New Dataset Name  Old Dataset Name ndt_intermediate   intermediate_ndt ndt_raw           raw_ndt  Extended views in ndt_intermediate: ndt_intermediate.extended_ndt7_downloads ndt_intermediate.extended_ndt7_uploads ndt_intermediate.extended_ndt5_downloads ndt_intermediate.extended_ndt5_uploads ndt_intermediate.extended_web100_downloads ndt_intermediate.extended_web100_uploads (These were previously published in the intermediate_ndt dataset.)  Raw Views Renaming  In the ndt_raw dataset, several views will also be renamed. All views to be published are listed below, with their previous name if applicable: New View Name          Old View Name ndt_raw.ndt7                       raw_ndt.ndt7 ndt_raw.annotation             raw_ndt.annotation ndt_raw.ndt5_legacy           ndt.ndt5 ndt_raw.web100_legacy     ndt.web100 ndt_raw.tcpinfo_legacy       ndt.tcpinfo ndt_raw.traceroute_legacy  ndt.traceroute  Thanks, --MM-- The best way to predict the future is to create it.  - Alan Kay	"{0: {'username': 'Livingood, Jason', 'response_date': 'Apr 5, 2021, 6:57:22 AM', 'response_content': 'Hi Matt â Are there more detailed release notes pertaining to the bug fixes?

These are just changes to the views that present the data from BQ tables.   The bug fixes were extremely minor - they were all corners cases that can not materially affect proper user queries.  You do raise a valid point about release notes though: we need to do better.  We are adding notes to the documentation.  Some of our users were looking at the details of how we are filtering the data, and encountered a problem with some rows that are normally excluded by our default filtering but also had invalid or corrupted geo annotations.  This caused exceptions from queries that attempted to do geo filtering on the extended views without row filtering.   I added BQ SAFE operators to force corrupted geo data to be expressed as NULLs.  Since these rows were also incomplete in other ways they never appeared in regular user queries.  Upload tests were reporting the server\'s Congestion Control Algorithm as the client\'s CCA.  This is partially a legacy of the old web100 based tooling, that reported upload and download results in the same row.  As far as I know, none of the current clients get this information at all, furthermore most clients use runtime environments that won\'t ever have access to it, due to sandboxes, etc.  Any queries that attempted to use the client\'s CCA were not functioning as intended.  In the bigger picture, MLab is moving to a reproducibility model that I nickname the ""NASA model"" - every bit of raw data is (and has been) archived carefully because it is precious.   As we improve our present tools we have an opportunity to use long running clients (aka beacons) to improve our understanding of past data, and to make improvements to our data pipeline, for example to infer noise sources, such as WiFi bottlenecks, ""testing in anger"", ""learned helplessness"", etc.   It currently takes us about 3 months to regenerate 3 B rows of BigQuery data from 11+ years of archived historical data.  The vision for this reproducibility model includes resources for A/B testing or comparisons across all processing changes, including recreating important reports such as the 2014 Interconnection study.

45	australian-speed-test-data-outliers	1632252779.0	2021-09-21 12:32:59	Bradley Kalgovas	Hi Chris,  We are looking into the Australian Speed Test data and we noticed that there are some outliers which don't make any sense to us. Specifically, since 1 Jan 2021: Within the Lower Murray SA3 (10902) which is comprise two SA2s (10902 1178 and 10902 1179) the 10902 1179 SA2 area has 274210 speed tests. This is much greater than Sydney Inner City SA3 (11703) which has 27,409 speed tests (see screenshot 1 and 2).  Also within the North Canberra SA3 (259,123), there are 259,123 speed tests. While this seems ok as it is the nation's capital, it is confusing as the areas around that do not have such a high level of speed tests (see screenshot 3) Kind regards, Bradley	"{0: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'Sep 22, 2021, 10:47:25 AM', 'response_content': ""Hi Bradley,  I think what you may be seeing here as outliers is more an issue of how NDT test results are geolocated.  The lat/lon coordinates in each NDT test row are a geolocation of the client IP address, as identified by the Maxmind Geolite 2 database. The coordinates are not the location of the person running the test, but the location of the infrastructure that provided them an IP address. A related field in the dataset, client.Geo.AccuracyRadiusKm, also comes from Maxmind and might be useful in your analyses.  To illustrate, I identified the geographies I think you're using, and loaded them into my GIS program along with all grouped lat/lons from NDT download tests in Australia this year. The results are seen in the maps below. First, the whole country, where we see what I might assume are clusters of tests mostly in the most populated areas. The second image is a zoom in on parts of Sydney, NSW, where you can also see some areas that don't contain geolocated tests.  I hope this helps explain what you're seeing, but please let us know if you have other questions.  Best, Chris   \ue5d3""}}"

If I am looking at data for a city broken out by the day, what does the variable ""record count"" mean and how would that differ from the sum of ""Ul Samples"" or the sum of ""Dl Samples""?   For example, I have data for a particular date that says record count = 24 and sum of Ul Samples = 1248. Does that mean only 24 speed tests were conducted on that day?

Could you be more specific about the data source? I think you are looking at aggregated data from one of our DataStudio reports, not querying the data using BigQuery. Is that right? ""record count"" sounds like a field provided by a DataStudio report.   In general, because of the way the NDT test works, the number of upload and download samples could be different. For example, if someone runs the test it appears to be one thing, but the upload and download measurements are stored separately. If a test is cancelled after the upload test completes but before the download does, then there would be one less download measurement than upload. The reverse is also possible depending on where the user ran the test. For example the Google search integration of the test runs download first, but other versions runs upload first.  Let us know more information about where you\'re getting Record Count and samples for a day, and if you are running a query, please feel free to share it as well.   Best, Chris \ue5d3'}}"

M-Lab subsidizes the queries only. However, there are some techniques I could recommend, and might be helpful to others on the group.  My first suggestion is to think about limiting the number of individual test results you need to export in some way. That could be by date ranges, or specific geographies. You may have a specific focus already, but still the data size is too large for export to Google Drive.  Another option is to save your query results to a BigQuery table in your Google Cloud Project, then export the table contents to Cloud Storage as CSVs, and you can then download the CSVs to work with in your analyses. This link provides some overview of options for extracting data: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data  You might also consider working with a subset of individual test rows in a series of test cases to refine your workflow. An initial, exploratory analysis could give you a sense of the individual fields and what you want to do with them. If that includes specific analyses that could be done within your query, you could then return to BigQuery and do that analysis in SQL to limit the final export you need to a smaller size.  However, if you are using other analysis tools and want to do that with individual rows, then you may need to incur some costs to do the export. Some analysis tools like R Studio for example, a have support for BigQuery, and could be used to extract data.  I hope this is helpful.

He participated in MLab from its inception in 2009, and came to Google in 2010 to find a larger platform on which to stand.  Dave Taht  Dave Taht and members of the Bufferbloat Project have made vast improvements to the Internet and to WiFi, as described in the book, âBufferbloat and Beyondâ. He has lectured at Stanford and MIT, NANOG, RIPE, USENIX, IEEE, and the IETF. His R&D work on AQM/FQ technologies on the Internet have been integrated into the Linux, OSX, and IOS kernels, cable modems, and many WiFi chips, and he has created and managed Internet improvement initiatives such as CeroWrt, make-wifi-fast, cake, and more. From these projects we have seen major innovations in congestion control algorithms such as BQL, FQ_codel, FQ_pie, and BBR.   Christoph Paasch, Networking Architect, Apple Christoph Paasch has been working on transport layer networking since 2010. Focusing on extensions to TCP, like Multipath TCP or TCP Fast Open. From specification (in the case of MPTCP) and research to the implementation and large scale deployments at Apple. Lately he has shifted his focus on improving the network properties that really matter to the end-user experience by exposing measurement tools to raise awareness to these issues. ""Responsiveness under working conditions"" being now the first primary target.  The conversation will be moderated by Lai Yi Ohlsen, Director of Measurement Lab, a fiscally sponsored project of Code for Science & Society.   Our casual conversation will include discussion about the significance of these metrics as well as the challenges their collection presents. We welcome audience questions, answers, challenges, and discussion. The discussion will be technical but no familiarity with M-Lab is required; all we ask is that participants review and respect our community guidelines.

We may want to support a functionally equivalent test using open source iperf 2, a new test to be written in python 3 using the open source flows code. I\'ve ok\'d any all test work done at Broadcom per our WiFi group as being something we can release as open source, including scripts developed per this test. https://sourceforge.net/p/iperf2/code/ci/master/tree/flows/  As an aside, we\'ve done a lot of work in iperf 2 around better TCP testing including things like --reverse w/small xfers, connect time measurements, write to read latencies, scheduling per clock_nanosleep, etc. More here https://iperf2.sourceforge.io/iperf-manpage.html  One recent feature we find extremely useful is support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT and select() based writes. We really appreciate some of the experts here pushing that through the network industry. The iperf 2 option is --tcp-write-prefetch <bytes>. It really helps with WiFi latency measurements to remove the send side bloat.

I think that this can be accomplished using an API such as https://ipinfo.io , by looking up individual IP addresses in the NDT dataset and pulling fields from their API. However, it's still crowdsourced data, so many things need to be accounted for when generating any aggregate analyses. See this post for a starting point: https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/mlab-data-policy-advocacy/  Perhaps others on the group have alternative suggestions as well.

Thanks!! :)	"{0: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'Jul 28, 2021, 2:39:19 PM', 'response_content': ""Thanks for asking this question. The two tables you mentioned are perhaps more useful for different purposes.  While the table v0_cities_asn contains statistics by city and ASN as generated by our statistics pipeline service, it does not currently contain a field that could be joined to NUTS geographies. This could potentially be added to the statistics output in the future during the generation of the statistics.  The tables defining EU's NUTS geographies are useful for geographic joins, using BigQuery's GIS support. These tables define the shape outline of NUTS regions in the geometry field. During the generation of statistics, we can identify the geographic region in which individual NDT test rows were geolocated using GIS SQL functions. NDT rows have a latitude and longitude annotation derived from geolocation of the originating IP address, and a GIS function can be used to identify which region that point is within.  This blog post provides an example query that uses a different geographic area, but demonstrates the approach you could use with the geographies in the NUTS tables to join individual NDT tests with the NUTS geographies.  So in summary, I would suggest that joining `measurement-lab.geographies.eu_NUTS_3_2021_01m` with `measurement-lab.statistics.v0_cities_asn` is not the right approach to obtaining cities aggregate data for NUTS3 geographies.  Instead, you could take the base query that generates the cities-asn statistics, and modify it to select only tests within EU NUTS 3 geographies, using the Geographic join approach described above and in the blog post.

The TCP info snapshots are like samples taken over the time an individual test is run. The many TCP info fields are the various metrics collected by TCP Info about the state of the connection during the test. As you note, there are many, and for researchers deeply familiar with TCP they will be more recognizable. For most people though, including myself, we summarize the metrics of highest interest like ""MeanThroughputMbps"".   As the NDT test runs, samples or snapshots of the ""speed"" or throughput are taken by TCP info, and the final field, MeanThroughputMbps is provided as the average of those samples.

If you are interested in looking at all ndt7 tests including those that failed, or were not complete, according to our team\'s best understanding, then continue using the ndt7 table.  However, if you are interested in only ndt7 tests that are considered by M-Lab to be complete and valid tests for understanding what ndt7 measures, then our NDT unified views should be your starting point for queries. For more information, this blog post discusses the NDT unified views and what they provide.  I also must recommend that you review our blog post, Using M-Lab Data in Broadband Advocacy and Policy, for our research recommendations when working with NDT data.  ndt.unified_uploads and ndt.unified_downloads allow you to query specifically for one or the other or both measurements, and these views are filtered to provide only tests that meet our team\'s understanding of test completeness. You can join the upload and download measurements using the UUID field if you want to get both...  To query the unified ndt views for only ndt7 tests, you can use the field node._Instruments in the WHERE part of your query. For example: WHERE node._Instruments = ""ndt7"" will return only ndt7 tests.  If the value of this field is ""tcpinfo"" then the test will be from the ndt5 protocol.  Specific to your questions about the schema pages and the measurements in the ndt7 table, my apologies that the schema descriptions on the website are not up to date. We hope to rectify that soon. The field names and descriptions are valid, but may not be complete or in the same order as those in the BigQuery tables. For the most current schema fields, I would rely in the listing in BigQuery as seen in the screenshot below, and for field descriptions, reference the pages on our website for now. The individual upload and download measurements in the ndt7 table are stored within the raw record section under raw.upload and raw.download. If the row is an upload measurement, the raw.upload fields will be present, and download fields will be blank or null. Vice versa for download measurements. So if you are looking at the field ndt7.a.MeanThroughputMbps, this value will be the upload measurement when the field raw.Upload.UUID is not null, and will be the value for a download measurement if the field raw.Download.UUID is not null.  I hope this helps.  Best, Chris \ue5d3'}}"

Couple questions: The pipeline mentions up coming additions and that \'block level\' may be possible. If so, is that scheduled anytime soon or no plans as yet? Aggregation by US Census Tract is provided for comparison/advisory only, and we do not plan to add census block level at this time. Though this is possible, we do not advise aggregating below city or county level due to the limitations on the precision of IP address geo-location.  Also, \'Cities are identified from the IP address annotations present in NDT data after it is published.\' - is there a list of city codes or how else could I understand what this code is for any given city? When an NDT test is conducted, the IP address from the connection initiating the test and the measurement itself are collected on the server through which the test ran. From there, a service we maintain annotates the test using publicly available datasets. You can read more about how this is done, what datasets are used, and a history of NDT annotations in this blog post.  Cities in the API are provided in the statistics pipeline API by name, and if you need an index of city names you can use the Maxmind Geolite2 City dataset. I\'ll also make a note that index tables may be a useful addition to make available in a future release.  There are several types of codes or numbers used in the API: * if you are looking at a URL with `/asn/` in the path, this is the Autonomous System number of the provider assigned to a range of IPs in the selected geography * for the US County statistics, we use the GEOID of each county as identified by the US Census Bureau * other codes are all geographic and include: two character Continent Code, the two character Country Code, and the 2-3 alphanumeric Region Code. Region Code uses the ISO 3166-2 standard, which in the US identifies the state. For example, US-MD is the region code for the state of Maryland. Also, the docs for pipeline say any geo unit is possible but not necessarily accurate. Can I pull data (even if not considered accurate at this time) from geo units smaller than City also? As mentioned above, each test is annotated with geographic codes using Maxmind\'s free Geolite2 dataset. This includes latitude/longitude coordinates, but is not the same at all as a street address or GPS precise location. See this information from Maxmind regarding IP Geolocation Accuracy. For this reason, we do not advise using NDT statistics for geographies smaller than county or city at this time. This blog post provides more context, where I explored and demonstrated these limits.  If you desire, you can of course pull individual data using BigQuery, and aggregate by any geographic shape you would like, but we wouldn\'t advise that the aggregated statistics would be at all correct.  There is one option for aggregating NDT data at geo units smaller than City-- collecting new tests from the location of interest using your own NDT client integration. This means collecting new test data, where you ask for or know the exact location where the test was run. Some of the links on our Data / Tools page can enable this. For example, if you wanted to collect tests automatically from known locations using a small computer placed on premise, you could use Murakami. If you wanted to run a website to survey a particular area and ask users to run a test, you could use Piecewise. Both require new data collection, and campaigns/resources of course, and though the NDT test results from these tools still is sent to our public dataset in BigQuery, any additional location precision or survey results are not. Using these tools also then means you have to establish your own analysis workflow and tools. If using these tools to collect new data are of interest to your organization, we can advise and discuss with you. Reach out to us at sup...@measurementlab.net, or directly to my email address.

If I create a speed test site (publicly open similar to Ookla's) for people to come test their internet speeds, my site will be limited to running 40 speed tests per day?  Or was the definition of a ""client"" the end-user who is hitting the ""Run test"" button?  That end-user can ""only"" run 40 tests a day, but my website overall is unaffected?  Thanks!

Join us next Wednesday, April 28, 2021 from 11am-12pm Eastern for a presentation and follow up discussion with Matt Mathis, Research Scientist at Google and open-source contributor to M-Lab, who is considering ways to improve M-Lab tools for long-term use by Internet researchers. An introduction from Matt:   My vision for improving the calibration of longitudinal MLab data, is to reprocess historical data using new insights drawn from recent observations.   Since this process has the potential to affect the reproducibility of previously published results, we need to be careful to fully disclose and justify our changes and enable researchers to examine how our processing changes might affect their results.  Basic experience or familiarity with M-Lab will be assumed but questions will be encouraged. As always, we ask participants to review and respect our community guidelines.

While GCP does a good job localizing the client, identifying where the NDT node itself is would be extremely helpful at the point of test.  For example, in a dense metropolitan region, say NYC, NDT target hostnames with the LGA IATA (New York, US) often mean anything from 111 8th Ave., NY all the way to Secaucus, NJ and beyond.  I do fear that some cleaning of the NDT node registrations is going to be required as well because when I look in ndt/tcpinfo on BQ, I see quite a few Server.Geo.{latitude,longitude} records that are not right, also IATA's that don't match Server.Geo.region.  So at least worth a review there too.  Thank you,    -Kris	{}

Today Iâm writing with the first of many newsletters that youâll receive on this mailing list. In each monthly edition, weâll provide updates about M-Lab such as changes to our platform and pipeline, data schemas, community tools, best practice analyses, community case studies, documentation and guides, and more. Ultimately, our goal is to communicate with you on a more regular basis, so we encourage you to reply with any questions or comments that come to mind. Additionally, as part of our efforts to communicate more effectively, weâve established a lightweight set of community guidelines that we ask participants to keep in mind as you engage here and on any other M-Lab hosted forum. If there is anything youâd like to see in these newsletters, please do let me know. And without further ado! We recently published two new blog posts. Using M-Lab data in Broadband Advocacy and Policy was written as a guide for researchers, policy makers, governing bodies, advocacy groups, or anyone who wants to understand M-Lab data and how it compares to other internet measurement data sets. We plan to continue to develop these recommendations for appropriate use of our data in analyses and reports. Requiring access tokens for ndt7 announces the requirement for NDT client integrations to use access tokens that are issued by the Locate v2 API. These requirements are relevant to anyone supporting an NDT integration. The latest versions of the ndt7-js, ndt7-client-go, and ndt7-client-android already support the Locate v2 API natively. Update to the latest version and youâre done! Upcoming updates In our December 2020 community calls, we announced the development of a pipeline to ease the use of aggregate NDT statistics into third party applications. We have soft launched the pipeline to a group of early testers and plan to release to the public in the next quarter. If you are interested in early testing, please let us know. Contract opportunities We currently have two projects that we are looking for a Javascript developer to complete. You can read more about them here. Please reach out to la...@measurementlab.net if you are interested. Recent events Project Director Lai Yi Ohlsen recently presented at NTIAâs February 2021 Webinar: Data as the Foundation for Broadband Planning, alongside Karen Perry, Senior Policy Analyst for BroadbandUSA and Bryan Darr, Vice President of Smart Communities at Ookla. The recording, presentation slides, and webinar transcript are available and are good resources for folks who want to learn or educate others more about the use of data in Broadband Planning. Community Call Schedule In 2020, we began hosting regular community calls where we discussed topics related to the M-Lab project and its related research topics.

We appreciate it!  We understand the need to test to both the closest server (the default), and to locations in other parts of the world. You are right that speeds to a server closer to you will not be the same as to a server elsewhere. We do have support to select different servers than the closest or nearest: the Chrome Extension is one.  In the Chrome extension settings there is an option to select a server in another part of the world, not the default ""nearest"" server. It should be noted that the Chrome extension uses the NDT5 protocol test, and the (now deprecated) Locate v1 API. Our Locate API service is what all clients will eventually use to obtain a list of servers through which a test may be conducted. The Locate v2 service supports ISO3166-2 Country and Region parameters, which effectively allow a client to select servers in another country or region. If/when the Chrome extension is updated, it will move to NDT7 and Locate v2. Supporting this feature might look like a list of countries and/or regions, instead of the current list of server locations. One other note about targeting specific servers-- M-Lab is moving toward not allowing this, but instead focusing on selecting servers by regional availability as described here.  From the perspective of Internet Service Providers, their contracted speeds are typically intended to be the speeds within their network. In contrast, the NDT test measures something different- speeds from your location to a server outside the ISP network. So our measurements are not intended to demonstrate that you are or are not getting guaranteed speeds, but to measure your experience uploading or downloading content to points on the Internet.  All this to say, that when clients are upgraded, they could make use of the Country and Region selectors. As our team has capacity, we are upgrading all clients we maintain to ndt7 and the Locate API service. Our code is also open source, and we welcome the contributions of developers in the community.  I hope this provides some useful context.

We briefly required access tokens from Nov 4th to Nov 9th, before discovering community maintained clients that had not yet migrated to the Locate v2 API (ndt7-client-android and ndt7-client-ios) and un-requiring access tokens again.  There are now complete or pending changes to add Locate v2 support to these clients. And we will again require access tokens after Feb 1st. For real this time.  Thank you, Stephen	"{0: {'username': 'Stephen Soltesz', 'response_date': 'Feb 1, 2021, 12:44:46 PM', 'response_content': 'Hello, the change to require access tokens for ndt7 clients will roll out soon.

79	reverse-traceroute	1611345170.0	2021-01-22 12:52:50	Colin McCann	Hi all, We are hoping to work with CIRA to expand on their internet performance testing tools (https://performance.cira.ca/), and had a couple of questions about your traceroute offerings. What we hope to do is have users do reverse traceroutes (eg from target server to user IP), and then provide the user with direct feedback based on the results. Is this something that is achievable? Or do we need to wait for the results to be updated in That traceroute results would be returned is somewhat implied here: https://support.measurementlab.net/help/en-us/9-platform/1-what-is-m-lab. However, I'm not totally sure I'm parsing it correctly (eg is the traceroute offering a subcomponent of the NDT offering? The data structures seem to imply that...)  A couple other quick questions: - where can I look at the source code for the reverse TR? - I've been looking at the data in BigQuery / measurement-lab / ndt / traceroute. Is this the correct place to be looking? Are there other places in addition? - is there a delay between when results are created and when they are available for query?  Thanks in advance! Colin	"{0: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'Jan 22, 2021, 2:51:12 PM', 'response_content': 'Hi Colin, Thanks for posting these questions. I\'ll reply here since you had two very similar threads, and this is the most current.  First, we should distinguish Traceroute from Reverse Traceroute. On our tests page, we distinguish Reverse Traceroute - a test (aka ""measurement service"") from the Traceroute ""M-Lab Core Service"".  The Traceroute M-Lab core service uses the Scamper traceroute tool provided by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis, CAIDA. For every TCP connection made to an M-Lab server, the traceroute service gathers a trace from our server back to the originating IP address. These traces are collected on a per server basis and parsed into BigQuery.   Traces are associated with each measurement service like NDT and others, and are also available for TCP connections not associated with any M-Lab measurement service as well.  All traces for all connections are available in measurement-lab.aggregate.traceroute. Traces relevant to specific measurement services like NDT are provided within the dataset for supported services. For example, measurement-lab.ndt.traceroute contains the traces associated with NDT tests. You can obtain the traceroutes for specific NDT tests by joining or matching on the UUID field.  Where Traceroute provides path information from M-Lab server to client, Reverse Traceroute is a tool intended to provide the reverse path information -- client to server-- which would normally only be possible by running traceroute from the client side to the server. You can find more information about Reverse Traceroute on their project page. However, as noted on our landing page for Reverse Traceroute, this data is not currently parsed into BigQuery. However, our team is actively working with the developers of Reverse Traceroute make that a possibility. As for running Reverse Traceroute to gather new reverse traces, we will need to inquire with their team to document client usage once the team reaches their re-launch milestone for this test. It is in the process of being updated to be supported on our Kubernetes based server platform.  Our Reverse Traceroute page provides links to the source code and currently available data.  Regarding our data publication process, expect that there will be an ~2 business day delay between the point when a test like NDT is run, and the data for that test being available in BigQuery. I expect the same would be true for traceroute. So in terms of real time access, this isn\'t really possible now, but can be provided after the fact. For example for CIRA\'s IPT tool, this could be something you provide to users who create an account perhaps.  I hope this response is helpful. Please let us know if you have additional questions.  Best, Chris - M-Lab Support \ue5d3'}}"
80	traceroute-generation-real-time-results	1611345166.0	2021-01-22 12:52:46	Colin McCann	Hi all,  We are working with CIRA on enhancing some of their tools. These tools use MLAB tests under the surface (https://performance.cira.ca/). One thing we are particularly interested in is being able to run reverse traceroutes and display the results to users in (semi) real time. Is this a possibility? Or is only the pattern [create traceroute - submit traceroute to mlab DB - query mlab DB for traceroute]? This is implied here (https://support.measurementlab.net/help/en-us/9-platform/1-what-is-m-lab), but I'm not sure I'm parsing it correctly.  Other quick questions: - I have been looking through the data in BigQuery / measurement-lab / ndt / traceroute. Is that the correct place to be looking for results? Does this cover both traceroutes and reverse traceroutes? Are there other tables of interest for these? - is there a time gap between when a traceroute is created and when it is queryable? - is reverse traceroute considered a subset of the NDT toolset? I wouldn't have assumed that, but the way the data is organized seems to imply it  Thanks in advance Colin	{}

Thank you for developing such tool. But I have a challenge currently and it does require urgent attention.   I have been reading my network connectivity, and exported it as a CSV file. I can understand what some of the variable measures are but bulk of it I donât have a clue to it.

Here is a summary of the topics we covered:    Collaboration Through 2021 and beyond, M-Lab would like to pursue more collaboration with the Internet Research community. We invite the insight of others to point our blindspots and help us find solutions to our unique challenges. Towards this end, look out for the 2021 Community Call schedule coming soon.   Data Multi-track views are available, which allow for the separation of your research question from data selection and grooming. You can see example queries in the slides. A blog post is coming soon.  We have many data types available other than NDT: pcap, tcpinfo, switch, traceroute, data-annotations.   Open Research Questions There are many influences on Internet measurement  data including the platform and the endpoint environment. We invite the insight and expertise of the Internet Research community as we consider how each of the following research questions are affected by one or more of these factors.   Platform Engineering: The effect of the design decisions made within Locate API, Geo Annotations and Switch Discards are currently tracked but unquantified and open for exploration.  IP Anonymization: IP Anonymization in radically open data is a âwickedâ problem. Test users want it, researchers don't, and regardless, the world is moving towards it. We are currently considering our options for how to preserve user privacy, remain open and maintain data validity. We imagine using client pseudonyms, issued by the locate service but are still in the design process.

Here is a summary of the call:   Defined broadband measurement terms: Bandwidth and latency, on-net and off-net, interconnect, access link capacity, end to end path capacity, single stream and multi-stream, and bulk transport capacity are all useful terms for you to know and use in your broadband advocacy/policy work.  They are specifically useful when looking at the different broadband data sources that are often referenced, including M-Labâs NDT data, 3rd party client integrations of M-Labâs, Form 477 data and Ooklaâs Speedtest. Talking points from these definitions and comparisons are in the slides.  We plan to follow up with a blog post for reference to document in more detail but please feel free  to reach out if you have any questions or would like to cite these definitions elsewhere.  Factoring Data Influences There are many influences on Internet measurement data including the platform and the endpoint environment. Our recommendations for factoring them in your analysis include:  Acknowledging that a number of things can cause the data to swing 10-30% in any direction. The data changing, by say, 90% is likely a real change. But considering context when deciding upon a threshold is important, and so we recommend not having a hard threshold, and if you do, we recommend it not be below 30%.  We strongly recommend distributions e.g. bucketing data into 1,2,5,10,20,50,100 Mbps buckets and looking at the fraction of tests in each bucket.  The best choice is always to compare the data to itself. Examples of this include: Compare competing ISPs in the same region Compare an ISP's performance to its performance last year When you do this, you are much more likely to be comparing apples to apples.  Common Analysis Pitfalls and Recommendations We also reviewed a number of common analysis pitfalls weâve started to recognize in the past few years including:  Excluding invalid data e.g. monitoring data, errored tests Failing to compensate for client bias M-Lab NDT data is a mix of infrequent manually triggered tests and beacons that test frequently. Without de-biasing, beacons often dominate the stats. Dividing data too finely; segmenting until there are too few samples in a segment to be meaningful e.g. rural zip-codes and census tracts may have only 1 or 2 tests per month. Oversimplifying e.g. using medians (or averages) to summarize multi-modal data.  We recommend avoiding linear scales and linear averages. We recommend digging deeper into multimodal distributions by examining the influence of ASNumber, of socio-economic and rural/urban influences, and exclude tests to very distant servers.  Our teamâs understanding of our data is always evolving alongside the communityâs; we invite you to share your insights as we share ours.  The slides from the meeting can be found here. Standard reminder that the slides and the summary are artifacts of a larger conversation. If you have questions about how the information was meant to be understood or would like to cite it elsewhere, please feel free to reach out.   Thanks to all who have joined us for the last round of community calls. Please look out for our 2021 schedule, coming soon. If we don't speak before, have a safe and happy holiday and we look forward to working with you next year.  \ue5d3""}}"

Thanks for inquiring about how to search the M-Lab datasets for per-country Round Trip Time statistics by mobile provider. This forum is intended to enable M-Lab community members to support one another in their analysis and research.  If you have attempted to search our datasets already and are running into issues or questions, it's best to post those details here if you need help. However, if you are new to querying our data, I'll share a few pointers to help get you started.  M-Lab provides the data for each of our measurement services (tests) and core services in BigQuery, and membership in this group provides you access to query M-Lab's datasets freely.  Here are some notes on the specific things you are interested in: Minimum Round Trip Time is available in the NDT dataset (see the BigQuery Views: unified_downloads  and unified_uploads) in the field a.MinRTT Many geographic fields in this dataset allow identification of results by country, city, region, etc. For example the fields client.Geo.CountryCode or client.Geo.CountryName could be selected and used as aggregation fields in your query. The fields date or a.TestTime can be used to aggregate by various date & time values. All datetime or timestamp fields are saved in GMT.  Identifying only tests from mobile operators may require you to use some inference if using the NDT test results alone. The originating IP address is provided in the field, client.IP, and the Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the network operator associated with that IP address is provided in the field, client.Network.ASNumber. We will also soon be adding values to client.Network.ASName, but this information can also be looked up online. For example, I often use the service, ipinfo.io, to lookup details about an IP address or ASNumber. You could identify all of the ASNs from tests in our dataset within your countries of interest in a given time period, and pick only the ones that are mobile networks to use in your analysis.  The ipinfo.io API service (with appropriate subscription) can also be used to lookup IPs and includes detail about whether the IP was from a mobile provider or not. Others on this group may also have suggestions for alternative means of identifying mobile or other access media.  I hope this is a helpful starting point for you to begin researching with our datasets.  Best,  Chris - M-Lab Support \ue5d3""}}"
86	updated-ndt-unified-views,-monday-2020-11-21	1605832001.0	2020-11-19 17:26:41	Matt Mathis	"On Monday Nov 21 we will be updating NDT unified views as a next step in the migration to our new parser and data gardner, as described in past announcements and our community call last Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2020.  These changes will make it easier for researchers to explore the data in ways we did not anticipate.   Most of the changes will not require changes to your current queries, but do bring new capabilities.  Changes that potentially affect current queries:  Publish temporary views that provide the current schemas for a short time, to enable users to continue using them while updating queries and applications.   For example, `unified_downloads_20201026x` and `unified_uploads_20201026x`, will provide the schemas for unified views as of 2020-10-26 (the current schemas).  Please let us know if this is useful, otherwise we may discontinue this service in the future.  Measurement annotations (geo and network information for the client and server) are now stored with the measurement data in materialized* BigQuery tables for most of our newest data (from NDT7).  These new tables avoid query time joins, and are vastly faster than the old tables for all location based queries.  Older tools and data will be converted to materialized joins in future updates;  The new geographical labels use CamelCase column names: ContinentCode, CountryCode, CountryCode3, CountryName, MetroCode, AreaCode, PostalCode, AccuracyRadiusKm, etc.   Queries using old column names containing underscores will need to be updated;  BigQuery now enforces that all queries contain a WHERE clause on date to prevent people from accidentally accessing the entire data set.   This update also removes the column `test_date` to complete the transition announced earlier - use column `date`;  Publish new extended views in the intermediate_ndt dataset: these are strict supersets of the raw data augmented with non-standard columns carrying interim results, provenance labeling and other internal information.    The additional columns are not standardized and are subject to future breaking changes or removal.   Since they are not uniform between measurement tools or tool versions, these tables can not be combined (UNIONed) without filtering columns.   An upcoming blog post will describe how to efficiently use the extended views;  Note that we are gradually deprecating all older tables and views.  If the last row in a table is older than 2020, assume that it has been (or will be) migrated into the new unified view framework.   Please retire all code that uses older tables.  *The output from a slow or complicated query can be stored or ""materialized"" as a table to provide faster access to common intermediate results.

87	interval-of-tcp_info-measurements?	1601388456.0	2020-09-29 07:07:36	Ralf LÃ¼bben	Hello,  I just have looked into the tcp_info measurements and I'm wondering how often the tcp_info reports are stored.  From the description and the code of tcp_info (https://github.com/m-lab/tcp-info/blob/master/collector/collector_linux.go), I expect an interval 10 milli seconds but the entries in the bigquery database and also in the related archive file shows less reports, also I cannot deduce the measurement interval from the file. The intervals seem be irregular.  For example the entry  SELECT * from ndt.tcpinfo WHERE UUID='ndt-sk6z6_1589402225_0000000000160252'  returns 4 entries for the tcp_info and the related archive  gs://archive-measurement-lab/ndt/tcpinfo/2020/06/07/20200607T011902.513578Z-tcpinfo-mlab2-lax06-ndt.tgz  including the tcp_info messages contains about 29 records (including the header) for a measurement of multiple seconds.  Is my expection wrong that tcp_info records are stored each 10 milli seconds or do I look at the wrong place for the raw data?  Thank you very much.

We're in an early field test EFT phase for iperf 2.0.14.  One of the new aspects is support for end to end read to write latencies, i.e. speed and capacity, which is a direct measurement of both.

I do talk with the iperf 3 team and have some idea of their goals.   The number of 2 vs 3 might be confusing as people think a larger number suggests the same but better.  In this context, 2 vs 3 are completely different code bases.   One technical thing that's been missing by my judgment is direct measurements of both capacity (peak average throughput) and speed (latency.)  Some use throughput/latency or network power as the metric to optimize.  Ping and packet latencies aren't necessarily good proxies for actual use experience.  I think the write-start to read-complete latency is much better.  Also things like connect times (TCP 3WHS) are a big deal too and should be measured.  We've added a lot to 2.0.14 per our semi-conductor customers.  We supply NICs, WiFi chips, switch fabric chips, etc. for all types of device and network equipment and this broad customer base has provided some inputs to the features implemented.  Bob \ue5d3""}}"

The quantiles aggregation in your query for example, can now be accomplished with the APPROX_QUANTILES function, or other aggregate functions. BigQuery\'s docs are really good.  There have been many changes to our platform and table/view schemas since 2018, and the upshot is that to query NDT data for tests that meet our team\'s current, best understanding of test completeness and research quality. In addition to working on new documentation and tutorial content, our team has re-engineered how we publish data so that we can present views and tables that meet the needs of researchers in our community who have a wide range of expertise and needs.  In July we published a blog post that describes our work to standardize the columns provided in our BigQuery datasets, to better enable Long Term Support of stable schemas. The post discusses the first recognizable outcome of that work to our community: ""unified"" views of NDT data that span the entire archive with a standardized schema. Additionally, this blog post provides more details about the NDT unified views.  We now publish two series of BigQuery Views for NDT data: ""Faithful"" and ""Helpful"". As described on the NDT page:  Faithful Views: Faithful Views are the base tables/views for each NDT data type, providing direct access to the unfiltered NDT data and the TCP INFO and Traceroute data associated with NDT tests. In BigQuery, Faithful Views are provided in datasets prepended with raw_ Faithful views will be of interest mostly to researchers interested in all testing conditions and results. Helpful Views: A set of tables/views derived from âFaithful Viewsâ that are pre-filtered to only provide the most commonly used fields, and which only show tests that meet our current, best understanding of test completeness and research quality. More details on what constitutes âresearch qualityâ is listed on the NDT page linked above. In BigQuery, Helpful Views are provided in datasets labelled for each experiment. Helpful views should be the starting point for most people. There are now three NDT protocol types in our dataset: web100, ndt5, & ndt7 . We have schemas with field descriptions for each protocol on their respective pages on our website, and hope to soon mirror those descriptions in the BigQuery website.  All NDT data prior to ~ November 2019 will be of the web100 protocol, derived from the web100 Linux kernel TCP statistics engine we used before our platform upgrade. In that upgrade, we began using TCPINFO to gather TCP statistics. One of the outcomes of this change is that some fields that you may have used in the web100 protocol NDT data may not be available in TCPINFO.  You can use sub-queries to pull data and metadata from the different protocols, by using the node._Instruments field in the unified views, which indicates the test protocol version: ndt5, ndt7, or web100.   If you are updating past queries, please begin by querying the appropriate ""Helpful Views"" for upload or download test results: `measurement-lab.ndt.unified_downloads` `measurement-lab.ndt.unified_uploads` Instead of having to calculate measurements from component fields as is the case in the query posted here, we now provide fields that are named more logically. Below are a series of fields from old tables/views, and their equivalents in unified_uploads and unified_downloads: log_time = a.TestTime  connection_spec.client_ip = client.IP download_Mbps = unified_downloads.a.MeanThroughputMbps  upload_Mbps = unified_uploads.a.MeanThroughputMbps connection_spec.client_geolocation.latitude  = client.Geo.latitude connection_spec.client_geolocation.longitude = client.Geo.longitude connection_spec.client_geolocation.postal_code = client.Geo.postal_code connection_spec.client_geolocation.region = client.Geo.region  connection_spec.client_geolocation.country_code  = client.Geo.country_code You can review the schema column names in the unified views in BigQuery for a complete list of available fields, for example: unified_downloads If you don\'t see a field that you need in the unified views, the next step is to see if the field is available in the Faithful view for the test protocol. For example, Min and Max RTT have equivalent fields for the download (S2C) test in ndt5 and ndt7 tables: web100_log_entry.snap.MaxRTT web100_log_entry.snap.MinRTT ndt.ndt5.result.S2C.MinRTT ndt.ndt5.result.S2C.MaxRTT ndt.ndt7.result.S2C.MinRTT ndt.ndt7.result.S2C.MaxRTT These can be pulled into your unified views query by matching on the test UUID, for example: WHERE ndt.unified_downloads.a.UUID = ndt.ndt5.test_id  The UUID field is a unique ID for each TCP connection to any of our servers, and is very useful for matching and joining generally.  One last thing to note is that interactions like this are helpful input for our engineering team for future releases of the unified views\' schemas. They included the most often used fields at first, and will add others as feedback comes in from the community where it makes sense to do so. We\'re looking for your input, so please let us know your thoughts.  Best, Chris \ue5d3'}}"

So I'm starting a new conversation for the purpose of adding a clarification to my previous post.  A little bit of background in case the previous post could not be found:  We are developing a monitoring system for a community network in South Africa. There's going to be a central server against which certain network measurements will be taken, and a bunch of Raspberry Pis will be there for collecting the network data. So far I've been able to run tests locally on my laptop using the dockerized golang application ndt-server, provided by M-Lab (https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server), and the test data was stored in JSON format locally. The question goes as under:  We would like to alternate the measurements against M-LAB servers and our own servers. Is it possible for us to keep a copy of the measurement data that would normally be going to MLab servers?  Also, in case if it is not possible for us to keep a copy of the data, is it possible to have the data returned to the NDT clients (Raspberry Pis in our case) so that it can be further modified and sent to the server of our choice?  Regards, Taveesh	"{0: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'Aug 31, 2020, 5:44:37 AM', 'response_content': ""Hi Taveesh, Sorry about your initial post, we moderate the group posts so I've released this one. Thanks for sharing about your project.  You can certainly alternate measurements against M-Lab servers and your own, as well as keep a copy of each test in addition to having the results of tests to M-Lab servers go to our dataset.  In the ndt7-client-go client, there is a `-hostname` flag that can be used to direct a test to your self-hosted ndt-server. You can also use the `-format` flag to save output in JSON and redirect the output to a local file.  You might consider looking at our Murakami code repository for this purpose, or examining the code for ideas to use in your own solution. Murakami uses Docker to manage a Docker measurement container on Raspberry Pi and other platforms. The container can be configured to run one or more M-Lab (and non-M-Lab) tests, to our servers or others, on a randomized schedule. Test result data for each device can be saved on-disk, or uploaded to a central archive in either Google Cloud Storage or to your own SCP service.  I hope this is helpful, and please let us know if you have more questions.

However, they periodically produce the following error: download (or upload) failed:  No available M-Lab servers  Any idea on what may be causing this?  Also, is there a way to use the M-Lab servers to get a udp latency result?

If you are using the ndt7 Golang client there is a flag `-hostname` which you could use to test against a specific ndt-server (including a self-hosted one). Self hosting might be ideal if you are testing a large number of devices. You may also be interested in our Murakami code repository, which provides a means for running regular M-Lab and non-M-Lab tests from any machine that supports Docker,.  Regarding UDP latency, unfortunately we do not currently host a measurement service that provides this.  Chris Ritzo - M-Lab Support \ue5d3'}}

100	advice-on-why-collected-median-speeds-seem-so-much-lower-than-reality.	1589824708.0	2020-05-18 10:58:28	Daniel Thomas	Hi There,  I've written up some code in Python to go out and gather internet speeds in 500 major global cities as a part of a benchmarking effort. The data is pulled through BigQuery, within a Jupyter Notebook  I've tweaked the standard Common Metrics queries, and combined them with a bounding box of longitude and latitudes to gather metrics for each city. I pull the big query results into a pandas data frame from where I perform a whole bunch of aggregation.  My issue is that the results I pull for many Chinese/Asian cities seems to be substantially lower what we would expect, and substantially lower than is recorded in Measurement labs own visualisations. I am wondering if I need to filter out more tests or something along these lines.   For example, 3 Mbs - Median speeds for Hong Kong based on the common metrics query. 19 Mbs - Median speeds for Hong Kong based on the Mlab visualisation   My BigQuery query to  the collect download data is as follows:    SELECT       `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.city AS city,       partition_date,       8 * (web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsReceived/web100_log_entry.snap.Duration) AS mbps,       `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.`country_code` AS country_code,       `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.`country_name` AS country_name,       `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.latitude AS latitude,       `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.longitude AS longiude,       `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.`metro_code` AS metro_code,       `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.region AS region    FROM     `measurement-lab.ndt.recommended`   WHERE      `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.latitude 22.09912108658368 AND 22.4600543490944     AND `connection_spec`.`client_geolocation`.longitude BETWEEN 113.99481156645193 AND 114.38262545045124     AND partition_date BETWEEN '2019-08-01' AND '2019-10-30'      # Default queries here     AND connection_spec.data_direction = 0     AND web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsReceived >= 8192     AND web100_log_entry.snap.Duration >= 9000000     AND web100_log_entry.snap.Duration < 600000000     AND (web100_log_entry.snap.State = 1         OR (web100_log_entry.snap.State >= 5         AND web100_log_entry.snap.State <= 11))      LIMIT 30000  To calculate medians in Python, I simply perform a .median() function on the 'mbps' column in a pandas data frame (returned from the query above)	"{0: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'Jun 12, 2020, 8:30:19 AM', 'response_content': ""Hi Daniel, Thanks for posting your question and the query you're using. Awesome!  On first glance, not related to the measurement difference you identified, a couple of things to note. - The Visualization website is in the process of being upgraded, so your second link will result in an error- wanted to mention in case others clicked on it. - The table/view you are querying,     `measurement-lab.ndt.recommended`   , has been recently replaced with a new set of NDT views that will simplify the query. `measurement-lab.ndt.unified_uploads` and `.unified_downloads` provide most of the core fields people are interested in, and allow querying NDT across our platform upgrade in November 2019. For data beyond November, you will need to use the new views. This blog post discusses the unified views in more detail. - Hong Kong is considered a country in our dataset. We use the ISO 3166-2 standard for the country code and country name fields, and the first level ISO 3166-2 subdivision for region. Soon we will also add the second level subdivision region codes and names for both to the schema.  When we do analyses like the one you are doing, we typically will use a multi-step query that first computes the median per IP address, per day, over the desired date range, and within the geography of interest. Then we will compute the median of those daily medians. This is one way to reduce potential skew that could be introduced by many tests run from the same IP. Other methods might be to take one value per IP per day, like the Max value, and use those in the final aggregate.  Lastly, if you desire you could also do aggregation in your query. Below is an example rewrite of your query given some of the suggestions above, which also aggregates by country and combines both upload and download into a final set of descriptive statistics. The second query does the same, but also groups by country and city.  I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have additional questions.

I recall the data being at the census block group level. I don't know of an online interactive map at the granularity you need, but you could potentially download the data and map it locally. I've been working on a few things of this nature recently using QGIS.  Online map: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/acs-datamap.html  You can see how North Carolina used the ACS and FCC Form 477 data to created broadband indices.  https://bi.nc.gov/t/DIT-Broadband/views/2017CountyIndices/BBADPStory?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y  https://www.ncbroadband.gov/indices/  I hope that's helpful.

Because every measurement run using MK by default also submits measurements to the OONI collector, we know that there are several people who have also integrated MK into their network measurement tools and apps.  If you are one of those folks using MK, weâd like to thank you for using it and inform you that it is now deprecated. At OONI, we are now switching to a new engine written in Go which will be easier for us to maintain in the long-term. We encourage you to consider adoption of the new Go probe-engine for your tools.   We will keep maintaining MK for roughly one year and we will stop producing builds and applying fixes after March 14, 2021.  We articulated an upgrade path in the new README of the Measurement Kit repo for all the MK use cases that we know of. If you have questions, comments, suggestions, or use cases that we didnât consider, please let us know, either here or on GitHub.  Thank you, best,  Simone & the OONI team	{}

This is why Measurement Lab test servers are hosted in data centers that also contain major content providers.  On the other hand, as Kim Prince mentioned, many other speed tests attempt to measure only your last-mile performance, and as such are frequently hosted within the ISP they are testing.  Unless you are getting geographically mis-routed to a cluster that is unreasonably far away from you (possible, but hopefully unlikely) then it sounds like you are connected at high speeds to your local ISP, but your connection through that ISP to content on the Internet may not be as good due to latency (more likely) or congestion along the path (less likely, but also possible)*.  * - There are of course more than two opportunities, and network people are often pedantic, so let me note here that there are other things that could cause the slowdown. But latency and congestion are the two most likely culprits.    -Peter \ue5d3 á´¹Ì¶LAB | Measure the Internet, save the data, and make it universally accessible and useful.'}, 3: {'username': 'Ron Dallmeier', 'response_date': 'Jan 28, 2017, 4:27:42 PM', 'response_content': 'From the FAQ:  Why are my M-Lab results different from other speed tests? Internet performance tests may provide different results for a lot of reasons. Three of the main reasons for different results among tests are listed below: 1. Differences in the location of testing servers Every performance test has two parts: client: This is the software that runs on the userâs machine and shows the user their speed results. server: This is the computer on the Internet to which the client connects to complete the test. A test generates data between the client and the server, and measures performance between these two points. The location of these two points is important in terms of understanding the results of a given test. If the server is located within your Internet Service Providerâs (ISPâs) own network (also known as the âlast mileâ), this is referred to as an âon-netâ measurement. This approach lets you know about how your Internet connection is performing intra-network within your ISP, but it does not necessarily reflect the full experience of using the Internet, which almost always involves using inter-network connections (connections between networks) to access content and services that are hosted somewhere outside of your ISP. Results from on-net testing are often higher than those achieved by using other methods, since the âdistanceâ traveled is generally shorter, and the network is entirely controlled by one provider (your ISP). âOff-netâ measurements occur between your computer and a server located outside of your ISPâs network. This means that traffic crosses inter-network borders and often travels longer distances. Off-net testing frequently produces results that are lower than those produced from on-net testing. M-Labâs measurements are always conducted off-net. This way, M-Lab is able to measure performance from testersâ computers to locations where popular Internet content is often hosted. By having inter-network connections included in the test, test users get a real sense of the performance they could expect when using the Internet. 2. Differences in testing methods Different Internet performance tests measure different things in different ways. M-Labâs NDT test tries to transfer as much data as it can in ten seconds (both up and down), using a single connection to an M-Lab server. Other popular tests try to transfer as much data as possible at once across multiple connections to their server. Neither method is ârightâ or âwrong,â but using a single stream is more likely to help diagnose problems in the network than multiple streams would. Learn more about M-Labâs NDT methodology. I would suggest a couple of things. When you run the m-lab test, note which server it is running the test against. It shows you as the test is running. It would be something like: NDT.IUPUI.MLAB1.ORD02.MEASUREMENT-LAB.ORG  ORD is the airport code for Chicago O\'Hare in this example. It is certainly important to note, which server it used.  Another suggestion would be to select the ""Details"" from the results page. In here you will get a summary of the test results. This can shed some light as to whether the test observed any potential causes for bad results. Two big factors for TCP based throughput are Packet Loss and Latency. Here is an example: Your system: - Plugin version: - (-)  TCP receive window: 893408 current, 894848 maximum 0.00 % of packets lost during test Round trip time: 21 msec (minimum), 68 msec (maximum), 33 msec (average) Jitter: - 0.00 seconds spend waiting following a timeout TCP time-out counter: 232 473 selective acknowledgement packets received  No duplex mismatch condition was detected. The test did not detect a cable fault. No network congestion was detected.  0.9633 % of the time was not spent in a receiver limited or sender limited state. 0.0000 % of the time the connection is limited by the client machine\'s receive buffer.

We had received a couple of similar emails at the same time to our support address and replied directly rather than publicly. However, since this is a public list I wanted to provide a bit more clarity in a way that I hope may be broadly useful, rather than address one particular network.   While there are a number of speed tests that are available, they all have differences related to measurement methods and server placement that lead to divergent numbers. There are a number of papers out there that attempt to account for these differences, and we have tried to surface some of those themes in the FAQ in a manner that is comprehendible to the lay reader. M-Lab has always taken the position that \'more is better,\' even where M-Lab isn\'t used, and that the critical factor is understanding why those differences exist and how they tell different stories about accessibility and performance.  On occasion we receive inquiries from Internet service providers, typically small-to-medium networks that are interested in why their numbers are different from other tests. What we often find is that the issue is related to peering and topology between those providers and the networks that we are located in. M-Lab chooses prominent transit and content providers as neutral places for our sites that should reflect user experience â the names well known among this community, and not arcane locations. It\'s difficult to remotely diagnose particular networks from the other side, however, we generally find that in those cases where there are lower-than-expected numbers, some intermediary provider is experiencing degraded conditions, e.g. packet loss and higher latency. In one of the recent cases, we found that there were two or three networks between us and the provider, and there appeared to be substantial loss on that ISP\'s upstream â neither a failure with M-Lab nor within their network, but a real issue facing users.   In the past three years, we have expanded our presence in each market to include multiple sites, covering different providers for each location. This was meant to be a diagnostic resource for the community. I realize that the ""Washington, D.C."" label in some of the integrations of NDT is not so descriptive of these variables in a way that would better enable accounting of differences for those who know â especially when for each refresh of the page, D.C. might mean Level 3, Tata, X.O, etc. As I understand some other tests select servers based on latency, whereas most integrations of M-Lab and NDT randomly select a server within the same geographic location. Sometimes this sole difference is the most significant factor in the result, but both tests are correct within their context. This topology and selection factor seems like a more prevalent matter for smaller ISPs that are reliant on one or two networks for transit â in those cases, one directly-connected network will perform well, whereas others where there are additional intermediaries in the path do not perform as expected.   So, rather than platform issues, we tend to find those differences result from the more common infrastructure challenges that all operators contend with, which does have the impact on consumers reflected in the measurement. When questions arise, we encourage networks to check their peering between them and our sites in BGP, run traceroutes (check reverse traceroutes in M-Lab\'s BigQuery dataset), and conduct comparative tests across all sites in the region to see how they perform differently.   We have long meant to expose more technical information about our platform for those who are interested in metadata and documentation. As we update our documentation, we will aim to also have a ""FAQs for Operators"" that more clearly lays out how methodological and topological difference lead to different-than-expected results, and how to use M-Lab as a diagnostic resource. In the interim, we take such questions quite seriously and try to provide support to operators where we can.

When providers are well peered, we see closer parity with other speed tests which often host servers at the edge of their last mile networks. The other major difference is that the architecture of our test itself differs from other tests. Our test is a single TCP stream test where others use multiple TCP streams. The use of multiple TCP streams emulates how web browsers typically operate when downloading resources you request from the Internet. Our NDT test\'s measurement using a single stream conforms more closely to accepted standards for performance measurement.

124	best-way-to-keep-a-current-testing-environment?	1581350775.0	2020-02-10 09:06:15	Glenn Fishbine	A couple of years ago I downloaded a javascript library that you created that permits me to do the speed tests from my own server.  As new features come about, I realized that your current distributions are always better than mine, and you take into account location when assigning a server, which I do not.  Further it has a really sick headache with Safari.  The key difference between what you do by default and what I do, is I have the latitude and longitude of the actual location, and I don't mean HTML5 geolocation.  What I'd really like to do is run your most current test, and somehow get the jitter, ping, up and download speeds returned to my calling application so I can merge with my latitude longitude results.  Is there a browser independent way to call your test, let you do the testing, and somehow get a return value for jitter, ping, up and down?

(Nota bene: The NDT5 table will get geolocation data added, the migration just has a lot of moving parts) For now, to query the geolocation information, join the ndt table with the tcpinfo table, like:  SELECT ndt5.partition_date, COUNT(*) FROM `measurement-lab.ndt.ndt5` as ndt5 INNER JOIN  `measurement-lab.ndt.tcpinfo` as tcpinfo ON (ndt5.result.S2C.UUID = tcpinfo.UUID) WHERE ndt5.partition_date BETWEEN \'2019-10-15\' AND \'2019-11-11\'     AND ndt5.result.S2C.UUID IS NOT NULL AND ndt5.result.S2C.UUID != """"   AND tcpinfo.Client.Geo.country_name = \'Germany\' GROUP BY ndt5.partition_date ORDER BY ndt5.partition_date  And then you can see that Germany has lots of data: Row partition_date f0_ 1 2019-10-15 35361 2 2019-10-16 32341 3 2019-10-17 33809 4 2019-10-18 34078 5 2019-10-19 35931 6 2019-10-20 36907 7 2019-10-21 32207 8 2019-10-22 34505 ... Although our parsing has apparently fallen a bit behind.  Again, this ""you need to join to query geo information""  feature is a bug, and it is a bug we are actively working on.  In the future (meaning early next year) everything should have geo information and querying should be more straightforward.  For now, this is a note to say: the data is still there. You can query it right now if you want to.    -Peter  \ue5d3 \ue5d3 -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups ""discuss"" group.

Based on the link below it says - âThe web100 version of server will be decommissioned on M-Lab once ndt-server has been tested and launched.â Does that mean the Public web100 NDT Server will go away at the end of 2019. https://www.measurementlab.net/tests/ndt/ Yes, but not the way it looks like you are thinking. Every web100 ndt client is already an NDT5 client, so no existing clients should lose the ability to run NDT tests.               After that I suppose, are you going to support both NDT-5 and NDT-7 servers? Do you have any ideas as to how many servers do you plan to have for each protocol type? Could you please share your deployment plans for these Server types?  Yes. NDT5 and NDT7 will be supported on every server, just like today.  No clients should lose their ability to run tests. The two protocols will be served from different ports on the server.    I see that you have NDT-7 clients implemented in Go and C++11. Do you have any NDT-7 client implementationavailable in Python? Not that I know of.  A high-quality javascript client is coming soon, but that's not the python you are looking for.  NDT7 is *much* easier to implement a client for, though.    -Peter    Thanks   Alok      -- á´¹Ì¶LAB | Measure the Internet, save the data, and make it universally accessible and useful, always with the goal of making the Internet better for the people who use it.	{}

We are seeking a contract developer to improve and build new features for a web application called Piecewise. This application is a public engagement portal, providing a web-based survey, M-Lab NDT test, and asks the user to consent to share their location to enable fine grained spatial aggregation of the data. Deployments of this application have enabled communities to gather their own data to support policy advocacy at the local level. Most recently, the MERIT network in Michigan used Piecewise in a pilot to study the homework gap in their state (https://mi.broadbandtest.us/).  We now have funding to support taking Piecewise from a prototype application to a containerized or Software as Service product. This will enable more communities to easily deploy and use M-Lab tools and data for their advocacy, research, or public engagement.  The attached work scope describes the current application state, roadmap, timeline, as well as the budget we have to support this work.  If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to myself (cri...@measurementlab.net), or M-Lab Director, Lai Yi Ohlsen (la...@measurementlab.net).  -- Chris Ritzo (he/him) Program Management & Community Lead, Measurement Lab sup...@measurementlab.net	{}

This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the intersections and the interplay of the various approaches and solutions developed across these domains to deal with multimedia data types.  MMSys is a venue for researchers who explore: Complete multimedia systems that provide a new kind of multimedia experience or system whose overall performance improves the state-of-the-art through new research results in more than one component, or Enhancements to one or more system components that provide a documented improvement over the state-of-the-art for handling continuous media or time-dependent services.  Such individual system components include: Operating systems Distributed architectures and protocols Domain languages, development tools and abstraction layers Using new architectures or computing resources for multimedia New or improved I/O architectures or I/O devices, innovative uses, and algorithms for their operation Representation of continuous or time-dependent media Metrics and measurement tools to assess performance  This touches aspects of many hot topics including but not limited to: content preparation and (adaptive) delivery systems, high dynamic range (HDR), games, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, 3D video, immersive systems, plenoptics, 360-degree video, volumetric video delivery, multimedia Internet of Things (IoT), multi and many-core, GPGPUs, mobile multimedia and 5G, wearable multimedia, peer-to-peer (P2P), cloud-based multimedia, cyber-physical systems, multi-sensory experiences, smart cities, quality of experience (QoE).  We especially encourage submissions in the following Focus Areas: Machine learning and statistical modeling for video streaming Volumetric media: from capture to consumption Fake media and tools for preventing illegal broadcasts  Important Dates ----------------------------------------- Submission deadline: January 10, 2020 (firm deadline) Acceptance notification: March 16, 2020 Camera-ready deadline: April 17, 2020  Submission Instructions ----------------------------------------- Online submission: https://mmsys2020.hotcrp.com/  Papers must be up to 12 pages long (in PDF format) prepared in the ACM style and written in English. MMSys papers enable authors to present entire multimedia systems or research work that builds on considerable amounts of earlier work in a self-contained manner. MMSys papers are published in the ACM Digital Library. The papers are double-blind reviewed.

There are currently two versions of the NDT server: a legacy C implementation with known issues, and a rewrite in Go that we are rolling out at the same time as we are upgrading our platform software stack during the next few months, which we believe resolves many issues with the C implementation - greatest of which is that we can easily fix issues once discovered.   What is the timeline that you're hoping to release this feature? We also have a new protocol NDT7 that will likely be easier to develop and deploy a client for your use-case. However, it is still maturing. An alpha version is available on our staging infrastructure. As well, the Go version of the NDT server is also on our staging infrastructure. Do you see the same upload behavior from mlab4 servers returned by our staging location service? https://locate-dot-mlab-staging.appspot.com/ndt_ssl ** Would you be willing to talk with us so we can get a better sense of Cisco's deployment plans for NDT for our capacity planning? Would you be willing to consider adopting NDT7 instead? Best, Stephen     ** Note this is staging infrastructure suitable only for testing. Do not use it for anything other than testing - there is no guarantee of availability in general.

I work in Cisco. We are working on including NDT Client in one of our products. We are testing it against publicly available NDT Servers.   I am having some issues with the c2s test. It works fine most of the times but fails sometimes.   I have included the failure case (highlighted in yellow) where we donât receive the TEST_MSG from the NDT Server, and eventually the websocket connection times out. I also have included the case where it works fine shown in green below as well.   Could you please shed some light on why is the Server not sending TEST_MSG sometimes?   Any help will be greatly appreciated.   Thanks   Alok   Failure   2019-05-25 21:21:25,385 - AGENT - DEBUG - Test started.

As they say they're partnering with M-Lab, I built the ndt7-client program (trivial - yay for Go!) and ran that to try to find out a bit more about what's happening.  ndt7-client program consistently reports about 60Mbps down, 17Mbps up. Google speed test was reporting 2.7Mbps down, 17Mbps up.  The Google speed test is using the ""Dublin"" server (193.1.12.203), and ndt7-client reports that it's using ndt-iupui-mlab4-dub01.measurement-lab.org. The ""dub01"" makes me think that it might be an a similar location; it's also using IPv4. My ISP is TalkTalk.  Sorry if this is inappropriate for this list, but I wondered if someone might have some useful input here, especially as these results might be being recorded and taken as somehow representative.

The Google search team did build an integration of our NDT test, so in this respect they are using M-Lab as a service to provide that test. Once we have completed our internal testing and roll-out of the new NDT server, we\'ll circle back to the search team to update their integration. Side note- if you\'re on this group and currently integrate NDT, and want to learn more about NDT7, please contact us.  Great to hear you are trying out ndt7-client! Both the Google test and the ndt7 client are being directed to use our servers in Dublin. M-Lab names our server pods by the nearest IATA airport code to the location, in this case DUB for Dublin. If there are more than one pod, they are numbered as well (i.e. dub01). Whether the test is conducted over IPv4 or IPv6 first depends on the network you are running from-- if you have an IPv6 address and our servers have IPv6 addresses, then the test will be over IPv6. In the server name you referred to, ndt-iupui-mlab4-dub01.measurement-lab.org, the ""mlab4"" part refers to the last of four servers in the pod, which are generally used for testing. Since NDT7 is still in testing, your ndt7-client is being directed there.   Thanks for testing ndt7-client! Other M-Lab team members may have more to share in this thread, or may be interested in the tests you\'re conducting with ndt7 under real world conditions.

A bit more specific information in case it helps. I just ran ndt7-client, then ran a google speed test, then ran ndt7-client again. I\'ve attached the results of those two runs (min speed 57.4Mbps). In between the two runs, I got a google speed test result of 5.7Mbps down. After the second run, I ran google speed test again and got 12Mbps; then I just ran it again a moment ago and got 0.13Mbps.  Out of curiosity, I just started a google speed test, and then started ndt7-client while that was in progress. The google speed test started at about 0.5Mbps and continued at that level, but the ndt7-client results were showing at least 27Mbps (running at the same time!).  So it seems that google speed test is wildly inconsistent betwen runs, which I guess might equate to some throttling somewhere in the network, or... I\'ve no idea :)  Yesterday, I was seeing very low speeds to other providers such as Amazon EC2 us-east-1 region too, but I\'m not sure how much I can trust the measurement tool I was using (https://cloudharmony.com/speedtest-for-aws).  The slow speeds did seem to correspond with low speeds to other sites (I was struggling to run a Zoom video call, and other pages seemed slow to load), but I can\'t say for sure if there\'s any causal relation there.  I\'d be very interested to hear if there\'s anything more I can do to find out if there\'s a real issue here.    cheers,     rog.  \ue5d3 \ue5d3 -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups ""discuss"" group.

I know that the search team at Google has tested it extensively with Chrome, but perhaps less with other browsers.  In general, with respect to comparing speed tests (M-Lab\'s versus other platforms) I should also mention this recent blog post about NDT, speeds, and accuracy.  In any case, the second thing you mentioned was NDT7\'s measurement during the web-based test. It illustrates an important feature of the NDT7 client-- it uses BBR-based TCP flows to improve measurement performance in high-latency, high-bandwidth cases, and effectively implements a Model Based Metrics (MBM) approach to measurement. Quoting from the RFC: ""Model-Based Metrics rely on mathematical models to specify a Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite, a set of IP diagnostic tests designed to assess whether common transport protocols can be expected to meet a predetermined Target Transport Performance over an Internet path."" -- in other words, NDT7 uses MBM to effectively estimate the capacity of the entire end to end path, without having to flood the connection to congestion in order to do so.

The paper referenced below highlights the limitations not only of measuring with a single TCP connection, but also general limitations of any client-based speed test. Common limiting factors of such tests include home wireless connections, device hardware (e.g., the WiFi radio in your mobile device or tablet), and so forth. Another thing to watch out for is browser-based testing. Above several hundred Mbps, browser-based tests tend to be unreliable and inaccurate. Best-of-breed client-based tests such as Ookla have been steadily moving to native clients for this very reason. Itâs unfortunate to see these outmoded tests still being used and promoted.  Iâd recommend baselining using a router-based test, such as the BISmark one that we have developed (some modern routers, such as the Orbi, also incorporate the Ookla test directly into the router device; SamKnows is another example).  Unfortunately, NDT doesnât account for any of these limitations, and I certainly would not rely on it as an accurate measure of access ISP capacity, especially for modern access networks. It would be great to see M-Lab adopt a more reliable, standard measurement method; hopefully NDT7 addresses some of these concerns, but rather than re-inventing the wheel, it would be nice to see the designers of NDT join the academic and industry conversations on this topic from Ookla, SamKnows, BISmark, and other groups. Weâd make more progress by working together here.  If youâd like to learn more about device-based testing, Iâd be happy to follow-up off-list. Weâve been designing such tests for nearly a decade now and would be happy to help you get more reliable and accurate measurements.    -Nick \ue5d3'}, 6: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'May 30, 2019, 7:26:07 AM', 'response_content': 'Thank you, Nick. Great to have participation in our group from one of M-Lab\'s experiment review committee members!  As I mentioned in my reply to Jason, NDT7 does address all of the concerns addressed in your and Jason\'s paper. If you\'d like to test and confirm that yourself, the code repositories are all open and available. It would be great to see an update from you if you do decide to do that. I\'m not an engineer, so I\'ll again defer to my colleagues to respond to technical internals of NDT7 client and server. I\'ve asked at least one colleague to reply on this thread.  Thanks also for mentioning all the other speed tests out there, including BISmark, another M-Lab hosted test! I\'ve personally used BISmark in the past Nick, but can\'t seem to find the data it produces? Where can I find BISmark\'s raw data?  M-Lab encourages people to use as many tests as they think make sense for them. It\'s important to note their differences as well, and you paper outlines some of those differences. On the subject of Ookla and SamKnows, one thing I wonder about is their test methods and internals. Since both are closed source code and commercial products, perhaps, Nick, you have deeper insight into how their tests work and why you recommend them? I have tried both and agree they are quality products.   I also agree that using a standardized device connected to an ethernet port or running tests from the router itself eliminate many of the inconsistencies introduced by testing over WiFi as you mentioned. M-Lab is also doing this in smaller scale pilots, using similar low cost single board computers to automate tests.   To respond to your comment about engaging with the Internet Measurement Community, we actually do! Last year we invited all of our current test developers and the broader M-Lab community to our 10th anniversary event. Attendees included at least one of your peers in the academic community, and the original developer of NDT, with whom our team consulted before the rewrite of NDT server & client. We also regularly attend the TPRC conference, where many academics in the Internet measurement community present their research. It was my pleasure to attend last year and meet several of your peers and hear more about their work. Last year we were also sponsors of the annual Internet Measurement Conference, and coordinated a pre-conference workshop on mobile measurement specifically. We were also invited to attend CAIDA\'s 2018 AIMS workshop, but could not attend due to scheduling reasons. We\'ll be there this year though!   If you\'d like us to be involved in other conversations as you are with the FCC, FTC, and industry partners, we\'d be pleased to be there. As an M-Lab experiment review committee member, perhaps you could help ensure that an M-Lab representative is invited to be a part of those conversations and events.

Is there a paper on the method or experiments comparing the accuracy? Iâd be curious to see the results, because this is certainly an unorthodox approach, and in my experience, a router-based test that uses multiple TCP connections is pretty darn accurate.  Out of curiosity: Why not simply adopt the industry and research-community accepted approaches? Why re-invent the wheel?

As a transport protocol (real applications moving real data), single stream BBR is capable of filling huge pipes without creating large standing queues.  e.g. ""controlling to the knee"" at 10Gb/s * 100mS.  In these environments multistream BBR is less stable, because it needs large queues to signal between the flows in order to balance the bandwidth.  BBR TCP is different in that it constructs an explicit model for the network, which includes accurate estimates of the available capacity and min RTT, as well as measures queue memory size (only when small) and ACK compression/decimation.  One of the things on my queue is demonstrating that single stream BBR is more accurate than multi-stream CUBIC or Reno.  Jason & Nick do you remember my work on ""UCP unfriendly"" a decade ago?   The underlying root problem is that the algorithms traditionally used by TCP are out of scale and unstable in modern networks.  This adversely affects all applications, including measurement.   Multi-stream is a workaround for this scale problem.  BTW, BBR is Van\'s redo of Jacobson88, and everything we think we know about transport behavior is probably wrong, because all of our assumptions were derived from Jacobson88, which has some serious bugs.  We still have a lot of work to do, for one thing BBR is still a moving target, and our distro is pinned to a version of BBR that is slightly older than I would prefer.

In particular, how does the test cope for: (1) cross-traffic on the local network; (2) device limitations (including, but not limited to the limitations of the hardware radio of the device performing the tests); (3) WiFi interference and cross-fading; etc. ? Iâm pretty sure all of these are going to remain concerns unless you intend to deploy the client in CPE.  I believe that M-Lab still hosts all of the BISmark data (thank you!), and itâs also on AWS and locally on our servers. Info at projectbismark.net. Let us know if you canât find it and weâll help you out. All of the code is also public on Github. In addition, weâve now augmented the suite with application performance monitoring, as well as passive tests that infer application quality for many streaming video applications. Ultimately, as access network speeds increase, simply âmaxing out the pipeâ isnât really a relevant metric anyhow. Youâre most likely just measuring performance to M-Lab servers, in the best case scenario, and in other scenarios you may be measuring bottlenecks of the client software/hardware, home network, etc.  Indeed, Iâm quite familiar with the Ookla speed test implementation and design and am certainly willing to vouch for their methods, subject to the limitations of client-based testing, of course. (Note that Ookla also recognizes these limitations has embedded their tests in commercial APs and home routers, which is the way to go.) Ookla has a description of their methods on their website which you can read... SamKnows, as you know, has also been quite open in the design of their methods, and in the early stages we provided a lot of input on their tests. Both of these tests, I will add, use multiple TCP connections to measure throughput. BISmark does, too. So does our mobile measurement test. Ours are open-source, as well. I think Comcast also has a test, although I know less about that one (although I do believe it also uses multiple TCP connection).  If you havenât done any validation of NDT7 vs. Ookla, SamKnows, BISmark, etc. then I agree this is something to do.

The really powerful thing about Docker is that it completely decouples measurement SW version management from platform SW and HW version management.   This scales way better than integrating measurement tools into other peoples stacks and build environments.  A cool idea (that is NOT on our roadmap) would be a meta tool to compare CPE, prefix neighbors and client device performance measurements.

156	mlab-city-names	1558479400.0	2019-05-21 15:56:40	Glenn Fishbine	I'm working with U.S. and Canadian Census data and find that about 1/4 f the U.S.  and 1/2 of the Canadian city names simply do not match between the Mlab city and the corresponding Census city (U.S. & Canada).  I can work with partial data sets, and I can grab the latitude/longitude and make a good guess as to which city it really belongs to, but I can't believe Mlab's data is created by a random name generator.  Surely there is a list of cities out there that maybe can be cross referenced to the real city names?  Any hints please?  Also, for places like Quebec, I see that none of the french accent marks are in the bigquery data content.  I was kinda hoping there's be some language considerations, and I can work around that as well.  So recap questions: 1.  Where does the Mlab city list come from?  If I discover that, I may be able to create a concordance once I now how they define cities. 2.  What are the language types used to store fields in bigquery?  i.e.  I suggest they be updated to a UTF type.  Hoping for answers before I build a two-map side by side manual exception correction system.  :)  By the way, fantastic content and wonderful that it's so easily accessible.

157	naming-bq-datasets-after-m-lab-measurement-services-&-data-types	1557931273.0	2019-05-15 07:41:13	Chris Ritzo	Greetings M-Lab community members:  We recently published a blog post outlining our work to unify the naming of M-Lab datasets in BigQuery to match the measurement services and data types for each dataset.  These changes will require you to update any queries you use or that are used within applications or services you produce. Please read on for a brief summary or refer to the blog post for complete details.   Going forward, datasets in the measurement-lab project will be named for each measurement service, and views within each dataset will contain data relevant to that service.  Below is a summary of upcoming changes: For each measurement service (ndt, traceroute, sidestream, utilization), we will create a corresponding BigQuery dataset and view in the measurement-lab project that are managed by our data reprocessing service (a.k.a. Gardener). The current views for release candidates, versioned intermediate tables, and releases will remain unchanged as we migrate them to the per-measurement service dataset. LegacySQL support will be deprecated. We may keep a single LegacySQL view of the legacy data, but only support StandardSQL in any new views of the comprehensive reprocessed data. We will no longer offer any views that combine legacy tables and recently parsed data. The current release convention supports a hierarchy of releases, release candidates ârcâ, versioned release candidates, and versioned intermediate views. For now, these will remain unchanged until June 1, 2019. However, they will cease being updated with new data starting May 6, 2019. As we validate the output from Gardener, and retire the contents of legacy tables, new releases and release candidates views will be migrated to the corresponding dataset.

160	m-lab-is-moving!	1551379399.0	2019-02-28 11:43:19	Chris Ritzo	Greetings M-Lab Community!  After a decade of growth at New Americaâs Open Technology Institute, Measurement Lab will join Code for Science & Societyâs Sponsored Projects Program on March 1, 2019. Since our launch in 2008, M-Lab has worked in the public interest to measure internet performance around the world and share measurement data openly. This work will continue at our new institutional home.  Measurement Lab comes to Code for Science & Society after recently celebrating its tenth anniversary at New Americaâs Open Technology Institute. The M-Lab community and team are thankful for the supportive home that OTI has long provided, but are also excited to join the family of projects at Code for Science & Society, an organization purpose-built for hosting large open source public interest tech projects.   Code for Science & Society, the new host of Measurement Labâs operations, is a small nonprofit dedicated to advancing open technologies in the public interest. They work with partners across research, civic technologies, and new media to support the growth and sustainability of the public interest tech ecosystem.  M-Labâs work will continue to be supported by a consortium of research, industry, and public interest partners including OTI, focused on fostering, collecting, and publishing open internet data. M-Lab will also continue to collaborate with organizations all over the world to build out the internet measurement platform, do research and data studies, and inform policy work by regulators, policymakers, and advocacy organizations.   The M-Lab Discuss group has served the dual purposes of providing a community discussion channel and serving as a whitelist for providing free query access to M-Lab data. In the short term that will remain unchanged, but in the coming months we will be working on new ways to support, discuss, and communicate with you, so please look for communications from us about upcoming changes and new resources.   If you have any ideas of things you would like us to do more of, e.g. blog posts, data trainings, regular community calls or individual check-ins, events, let us know â weâd love to hear your ideas!

161	i-think-m-lab-testing-methods-are-poor	1547565146.0	2019-01-15 08:12:26	C W	I have run 11 internet speed tests, and this one from M-Lab is the only one that is consistently an outlier.  Your FAQs indicate that others use different testing methods.  While true, it appears that if you are the only outlier, your testing methods are the ones that are off.  Of the 11 tests I ran, 10 (non M-Lab) tests gave values of download speed between 65 and 70, while the M-Lab test consistently gives results between 1.74 and 8 Mb/s. I checked the other tests to ensure that the same units were being used, all were using megabits per second.  I do not claim to know how all this works, but it seems that running the test through a server halfway across the country may be part of the problem.  I am in central Colorado and the server used was in Los Angeles.  	{}

However, the tests i do to mlab are always through Dublin. (MLAB chooses the closest geographic location) This would mean my test traffic is first going to London, then to Dublin.

I second Jason's recommendation on Odroid for hardware. We are currently using Odroid C2 hardware and are doing passive and active measurements up to 1 Gbps.  As far as a speed test, I wholeheartedly agree with the recommendations below. We run this in our deployment, which we developed: https://github.com/projectbismark.  I would absolutely not use NDT for a speed test, especially if youâre interested in testing above 100 Mbps. Approaching gigabit speeds, things are much trickier in terms of both testing and the hardware itself, and we had the same problems with RPi/BPi, and much better luck with the Odroid devices.  Off hand, another thing you may be interested in looking into are metrics beyond âspeed testsâ, including application quality. To that end, we hav e developed some passive monitoring software to measure the quality of streaming video apps (e.g., Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, Hulu, etc.). Weâd be happy to help you with that deployment if youâre interested in application QoE.

Instead, you may calculate these using individual fields as described on our page, Calculating Common Metrics.  For example, if you wanted to get Download speed in Mbps, you would use this formula in your query:  #standardSQL SELECT   8 * (web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsAcked /     (web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeRwin +     web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeCwnd +     web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeSnd)) AS download_Mbps FROM   `measurement-lab.release.ndt_downloads` ...

Then to the question of averages, and other mathematical functions. As you construct queries to aggregate data, in averages, medians, quantiles, etc. or group by fields, such as country, please refer to Google\'s BigQuery reference documentation.  In your inquiry, average download and average upload speeds grouped by country require both using the AVG function, and GROUP BY statements in your queries. You will need to run two queries, one for download speeds and one for upload speeds.   Here is a basic example returning average download speeds per country for all M-Lab tests since 2009:  #standardSQL SELECT  connection_spec.client_geolocation.country_name AS country, AVG(8 * (web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsAcked /    (web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeRwin +     web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeCwnd +     web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeSnd))) AS average_download_mbps FROM `measurement-lab.release.ndt_downloads` GROUP BY country ORDER BY country  And here is the query returning average upload speeds per country for all M-Lab tests since 2009:  #standardSQL SELECT  connection_spec.client_geolocation.country_name AS country, AVG( 8 * (web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsReceived/web100_log_entry.snap.Duration)) AS average_upload_mbps FROM `measurement-lab.release.ndt_uploads` GROUP BY country ORDER BY country  Please note that I\'m querying different BigQuery views for upload and download tests.

We don\'t have anything like a wordpress plugin at the moment, but if you\'re interested in more accurate Geo Location associated with test results, there are some options. A number of cities [1] and other municipal areas [1] have been using an open source web app called Piecewise to host a survey form, the NDT speed test, and map aggregate statistics for a chosen geographic region. In Pennsylvania, there is currently a broadband testing initiative through the legislature\'s Center for Rural PA. These initiatives submit standard M-Lab tests, which are later annotated as described above, but the website integration separately saves more accurate geo-location using HTML5 in a private, non-M-Lab hosted dataset.

Thse fields would be: connection_spec.client_kernel_version connection_spec.client_os connection_spec.client_browser To properly separate mobile tests from non-mobile tests, you will need to use third party databases, as you mentioned.

174	are-all-m-lab-tests-guaranteed-to-be-'off-net'?	1538315228.0	2018-09-30 06:47:08	Zachary Smith	"Hi all,  I'm quite new to Google groups threads, so I don't know the appropriate way to engage here yet! Please let me know if I'm off the mark (and especially if I'm just creating spam).  I'm looking for specific ways to evaluate Internet performance in South Africa and am exploring the M-Lab datasets to see what's available. From the M-Lab status page (https://www.measurementlab.net/status/) I see that there is one M-Lab server setup in South Africa. I thought that this might mean that all tests in South Africa are therefore relative to this single server. But from the FAQs (https://www.measurementlab.net/faq/):  ""M-Labâs measurements are always conducted off-net. This way, M-Lab is able to measure performance from testersâ computers to locations where popular Internet content is often hosted. By having inter-network connections included in the test, test users get a real sense of the performance they could expect when using the Internet.""  I take this to mean that a testing-client will always connect to a server hosted on a separate ISP's network?  For the specific example of South Africa with one M-Lab server in one of the main business districts, could this result in the best internet connections (connections close to the data center where the M-Lab server resides) showing the highest latency/throughput times since there is a 'rule' that will result in NOT using the closest local server that is in the same Access network as the testing client?  In general, how is it ensured that test-client - server connections are all 'off-net'? Alternatively, if this isn't the case, is there a flag somewhere that indicates this?  Best regards, Zach"	"{0: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'Oct 1, 2018, 5:39:31 AM', 'response_content': 'Hello Zach,  Thanks for asking this question, and welcome to the M-Lab Discuss group.   M-Lab servers are always hosted outside of access networks, with direct connections to transit networks. This is how we ensure tests are conducted to off-net servers. Our architecture in this respect is similar to Akamai. To directly answer your question about the FAQ- yes, the testing client will always connect to a server hosted on a transit network.  The vast majority of testing clients normally are routed to the geographically closest M-Lab server. Some clients allow the user to select a specific M-Lab server to conduct an NDT test, for example if you compiled the NDT command line binary or install the M-Lab Measure Chrome Extension.

Internet development campaigners, national regulators, and policy makers in the developing regions are recognising  the crucial role that Internet measurement data can play in facilitating evidence-based policy-making and regulation. Given that the Internet ecosystem comprises a diversity of stakeholders and service providers it is difficult for any other single entity to access all of Internet topology data without the cooperation of the Internet community. For this reason, appropriate acquisition of Internet data requires a variety of cooperative research methods, including wide distribution of Internet probes for technical measurements, located in diverse locations and networks, as well as region-specific techniques and demand-side surveys on Internet access and use.  The aim of the workshop is to facilitate discussions around mechanisms and challenges of measuring Africaâs Internet; to evaluate the breadth of Internet measurements research and to formulate strategic directions for such research in Africa; and to initiate and accelerate collaboration among Africaâs Internet measurements researchers.  The workshop is calling for high-quality papers that are focused on Internet measurements research in Africa. Papers are invited on topics related to tools, methods and analysis of:  End-to-end Internet performance metrics Internet topology characteristics, including peering and routing Application-level performance, including DNS, Web, CDNs, Cloud Computing Physical layer performance measurements, including for TVWS, WiFi, and 3G/4G Mobile and Cellular technologies Detection of middleboxes, censorship, and content filtering Data analytics for network monitoring, traffic analysis and network Network topology and performance visualization Internet access, use, and Quality of Experience (QoE) surveys  Committee  General Workshop Chair Amreesh Phokeer â AFRINIC  Technical Programme Committee Ahmed Elmokashfi (TPC Co-chair) â Simula Research Laboratory Josiah Chavula (TPC Co-chair) â University of Cape Town Amreesh Phokeer â AFRINIC Gareth Tyson â Queen Mary University of London Alemnew Asrese â Aalto University Ermias Walelgne â Aalto University Assane Gueye â UADB-Senegal Roderick Fanou â CAIDA/UC San Diego  Publication  Accepted and registered papers will be included in the AFRICOMM conference proceedings.  Submission Instructions  See the instructions for paper submission here: <http://africommconference.org/initial-submission/>  Workshop papers will be selected through a peer-review process.  N.B Previous and already published peer-reviewed work on Internet measurements may also be accepted for presentation only. Presentations should be emailed to the workshop TPC co-chairs.

The FAQ you reference explains several reasons why the M-Lab test reports lower results than other speed tests, including single versus multi-threaded tests as Jason mentioned, and on-net versus off-net placement of servers as Sascha mentioned. M-Lab doesn\'t claim that our test is more accurate than others, but that it is measuring different network conditions. Different network performance tests use differing methodologies as well, which can account for different measurements. All the tests are as accurate as they can be for what they are measuring, and because they report similar metrics it is often assumed that their results should be equal.  I would characterize them as comparable and each accurate in their own right for what is being measured. The M-Lab NDT test measurements are more in line with Akamai tests, in that the server endpoints are off-net. Whether a single threaded test or a multi-threaded test is more accurate is still a question up for debate in the academic internet measurement community-- the article Jason referenced is one supporting multi-threaded tests, and earlier research points to single-threaded testing to be more precise in assessing overall performance. In any case, whatever the test used, they all provide some sense of a connection and I think that combined the results of each one can help paint a nuanced picture of your quality of access overall.

The citation on single threading you noted (from 1997 on âthe macroscopic behavior of the TCP congestion avoidance algorithmâ) is probably a bit outdated considering how substantially TCP congestion control and threading has changed in 21 years. But I know one of the co-authors (Matt Mathis) is on this list so heâd know more than anyone how all the recent changes may or may not affect their prior conclusions, since I am pretty sure heâs on the leading edge of congestion control R&D.   In any case, it seems you are right to focus on the right test for the right question; that is the root of it. It seems most folks think NDT is useful for identifying the location of network bottlenecks, rather than aggregate network capacity (speed). But it seems like a lot of people use it for the latter case when another tool may be superior for that question.

An ""ACK jitter"" parameter would be a side signal off of these algorithms, and the jitter distribution tells you about any half duplex in the path.

In our blog post in May of last year, we outlined that we were beginning changes to our data processing pipeline. That work is now complete, and our entire data processing pipeline is now open source and more extensible to new experiments. If you query M-Lab data, you'll want to review the full details in our blog post, as our BigQuery Datasets, table names, and view names have changed. The new open source ETL pipeline is one project in a larger initiative to update all components of the M-Lab platform, which we are continuing work on this year.  Additionally, because there has been a steady increase in third party integrations of M-Lab tests, we recently added a Developer section on the website. If you have feedback on these resources or suggestions for improvement, please let us know.

186	histogram-of-ndt-download-speeds-by-quantile?	1515096145.0	2018-01-04 13:02:25	Fenwick Mckelvey	Hi all, I am trying to improve my BiqQuery skills and I'd like to write a query to generate a histogram of Download speeds grouped by quantile. Below is a script that uses buckets of 10 Megs, but I'd like to find a way to use BigQuery's quantile function to create the buckets, instead of my hand-coded ones  then count the number of tests per bucket.  Any ideas?  SELECT CASE WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 0 AND 10 THEN 'Up to 10 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 10.1 AND 20 THEN 'Up to 20 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 20.1 AND 30 THEN 'Up to 30 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 30.1 AND 40 THEN 'Up to 40 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 40.1 AND 50 THEN 'Up to 50 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 50.1 AND 60 THEN 'Up to 60 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 60.1 AND 70 THEN 'Up to 70 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 70.1 AND 80 THEN 'Up to 80 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 80.1 AND 90 THEN 'Up to 90 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed BETWEEN 90.1 AND 100 THEN 'Up to 100 Meg' WHEN DownloadSpeed  > 100 THEN '100 Meg and higher' ELSE 'None' END as tiers, count(DownloadSpeed)  FROM ( SELECT  (8 * web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsAcked/(web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeRwin + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeCwnd + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeSnd)) AS DownloadSpeed, FROM     plx.google:m_lab.ndt.all WHERE connection_spec.data_direction = 1 AND blacklist_flags = 0 AND web100_log_entry.is_last_entry IS NOT NULL AND web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsAcked IS NOT NULL AND web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsAcked >= 8192 AND (web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeRwin + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeCwnd + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeSnd) >= 9000000 AND (web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeRwin + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeCwnd + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeSnd) < 3600000000 AND web100_log_entry.snap.CongSignals IS NOT NULL AND web100_log_entry.snap.CongSignals > 0 AND log_time > 1483228800 AND log_time < 1514764800 AND connection_spec.client_geolocation.city IS NOT NULL AND connection_spec.client_geolocation.country_name = 'Canada' AND (connection_spec.server_geolocation.country_name = 'Canada' OR connection_spec.server_geolocation.country_name = 'United States')   )   GROUP BY   tiers   ORDER BY   tiers DESC  Best, Fenwick	"{0: {'username': 'Chris Ritzo', 'response_date': 'Feb 13, 2018, 2:41:49 PM', 'response_content': ""Hi Fen,  We discussed a couple ideas on how to best use BigQuery to get to quantiles, but I wanted to share here also in case it spawns more discussion or helps others.  Your query looks good as a means of manually setting different levels for download test speeds. If you want to get normalized buckets for the quantiles, you can use the APPROX_QUANTILES function to get evenly distributed buckets of the inner select statement:  #standardSQL ### Approx Quantiles (5) for Download measurements in Canada or US  SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(DownloadSpeed, 5) AS approx_quantiles FROM ( SELECT   (8 * web100_log_entry.snap.HCThruOctetsAcked/(web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeRwin + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeCwnd + web100_log_entry.snap.SndLimTimeSnd)) AS DownloadSpeed FROM      `measurement-lab.release.ndt_all` WHERE ...snip...

What's the best way to match up clients in both ndt and traceroute tables?  I'm interested in the queries used to generate the interconnection report.  I can understand conceptually the methodology to figure out the bottlenecks at transit ISP borders, but for a given ndt run I want to know all the hops.

You may also wish to review the report\'s methodological overview: https://github.com/m-lab/mlab-wikis/blob/master/InterconnectionStudyMethodology.md  If you\'re wanting to examine Paris Traceroutes for NDT tests, the best way is to query for traceroutes that occurred to the same IP address within an hour of the NDT test.

188	paristraceroute-has-a-bug,-and-it-causes-some-bad-data	1516807545.0	2018-01-24 08:25:45	Peter Bootheâ¢	"Paris Traceroute has a bug, and it causes some bad data In December 2017, M-Lab was notified of oddities in the Paris Traceroute data. Upon investigation, a bug in the Paris Traceroute code was identified. The bug caused bad measurement data in 2.7% of the traceroutes since July 2016.   The M-Lab team is doing development to work around the bug in several ways: By changing how we call Paris Traceroute to reduce the probability that the bug condition occurs. By adding more sophisticated bad data detection and elimination code to our parsing of Paris Traceroute data. By adding monitoring to our parser so that we can know how much of our raw data is affected at any given time. By reprocessing our historical raw data archives in order to eliminate all bad traceroute data caused by this bug from our BigQuery database  Through disclosures and analyses like these, M-Lab re-confirms its commitment to open data and open science. Our raw data, warts, bugs, and all, is and will be always available ( https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/m-lab/), while our processed data (https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/measurement-lab:public?pli=1) continues to reflect our best understanding of the state of the Internet represented by that raw data. Read More: The bug and its fixes The root cause of the reported problem is a design flaw in Paris Traceroute, exacerbated by Rollins, the wrapper script that M-Lab uses to run it. The Rollins wrapper script went into production in first half of 2016 (replacing an older script which had its own flaws).  Every connection made to M-Lab systems triggers a Paris Traceroute to run from the M-Lab server back to the computer that initiated the connection. As the number of simultaneous traceroutes has increased, this has exposed a bug in Paris Traceroute where two independent traceroutes that overlap in time can become intermixed in the resulting Paris Traceroute output.  For example, if we were to simultaneously run a traceroute from server S to clients A and B, the S-A path reported by the tool might contain hops that are exclusive to the S-B path, or it could switch in the middle of Paris Traceroute's output from being the S-A path into being the S-B path.   In the following example, the output from Paris Traceroute switches without warning from being the output for  $ paris-traceroute 35.188.101.1 into containing the data for the contemporaneously-run command $ paris-traceroute 139.60.160.135 The resulting output from the first command (shown below) shows a link that doesn't exist from 216.239.51.185 to 173.239.28.18, on lines 8 and 9 and (worse!) switches without warning into the output from the second command (which we have highlighted in orange, and we have highlighted the suspiciously large RTT in red):  traceroute [(173.205.3.38:33458) -> (35.188.101.1:40784)], protocol icmp, algo exhaustive, duration 14 s  1  P(6, 6) 173.205.3.1 (173.205.3.1)  0.138/5.405/31.541/11.688 ms   2  P(6, 6) xe-1-0-6.cr2-sjc1.ip4.gtt.net (89.149.137.5)  19.090/21.052/24.168/1.898 ms   3  P(6, 6) as15169.sjc10.ip4.gtt.net (199.229.230.134)  19.105/19.611/21.314/0.796 ms   4  P(6, 6) 108.170.243.13 (108.170.243.13)  19.872/20.275/20.931/0.446 ms   5  P(6, 6) 209.85.246.206 (209.85.246.206)  20.092/20.545/21.096/0.331 ms     MPLS Label 697177 TTL=1  6  P(6, 6) 209.85.248.127 (209.85.248.127)  53.493/54.490/57.796/1.493 ms     MPLS Label 638493 TTL=1  7  P(6, 6) 216.239.47.251 (216.239.47.251)  52.755/56.170/67.922/5.386 ms     MPLS Label 402431 TTL=1  8  P(6, 6) 216.239.51.185 (216.239.51.185)  52.455/52.652/52.981/0.228 ms   9  P(6, 6) csd180.gsc.webair.net (173.239.28.18)  4802.776/4803.621/4807.622/1.790 ms  10  P(6, 6) 173.239.11.1 (173.239.11.1)  66.509/66.524/66.561/0.018 ms  11  P(6, 6) 173.239.57.74 (173.239.57.74)  66.634/69.047/72.354/2.442 ms  12  P(6, 6) 139.60.160.1 (139.60.160.1)  67.066/70.367/72.034/2.327 ms  13  P(6, 6) 139.60.160.135 (139.60.160.135)  62.542/64.001/66.941/2.020 ms  This is obviously quite worrying, so the M-Lab team set about investigating why this is happening, how to prevent (or at least reduce the frequency of) its occurrence, and how to filter or annotate bad data in our database (while, of course, preserving the original raw data in our historical archives).  Paris Traceroute relies on a single 16 bit ""tag"" field to disambiguate returning ICMP messages, and that tag is essentially the output of a hash function. This single field is used both to identify which request packet (what initial TTL) and which session it belongs to. When there are two overlapping tests, it is possible to have a collision of tag values, exactly analogous to a hashtable collision. When one test starts first, that test runs for a bit, and then after the second (colliding) test starts, spurious data begins to arrive to the first test. The symptoms of this are that, in the middle of the first test, the results of the second test begin to pollute the results of the first. Just like with hash tables, the incidence rate of this bug scales up with usage. Sites with minimal numbers of connections saw no collisions, and sites with large numbers of connections saw an increased percentage of tests affected.   To prevent the collection of bad data, we have created a workaround in our Paris Traceroute wrapper to bring down the expected number of incidents and that workaround will be deployed to M-Lab servers soon.  To prevent the inclusion of any bad data in our BigQuery tables, we are porting the detection code from a standalone tool into our parser. We are also adding monitoring to measure the error rates going forwards.  We will soon be reparsing our historical archives, and over the next quarter as all our historical archives get reprocessed, all bad data caused by this bug should be eliminated from or tagged within our BigQuery database. M-Lab's raw data will remain untouched, as our raw data reflects the data we actually got from M-Lab servers, not the data we wish we had gotten from M-Lab servers.  Once remediation is completed, we will provide a longer write up going in to more depth about the issue and the remediation.

Origin and destination country data is available for clients/server but these statistics don't seem to be calculated per hop for the Paris Traceroute data. The goal is to determine how much traffic leaves the country via boomerang redirection.  I'm curious to know if there is a table containing geodata for paris traceroute data that can be queried or if there is a way to determine the geolocation of paris traceroute hops (origin and destination) using BigQuery.

Given the limitations of Maxmind for locating routers, I thought using country might be an acceptable level of geolocation.  Our issue seems to be the BQ data.

We used it to geolocate the border routers between ASes in a set of traceroutes from 30 Ark vantage points to 360K prefixes, and it worked very well. We could locate 82% of the border router IP addresses to be within 1ms or less of a VP with a known location.  We could not locate 10% of IP addresses because they did not respond to pings, and 8% were responsive but we were unable to find a vantage point within 1ms. Due to Vasilis's very smart vantage point selection, our technique probed each IP address from an average of only 8.3 vantage points in order to find the nearby one. - Vasilis built the technique into a service as part of a new RIPE service that uses multiple techniques to provide geolocation results.

We find it works fine. Thank you for making it upgraded.  However, there's something of Mlab NDT data and it's assocation with Pairs Trace route that caught our attention.  Firstly, we find there is an Client IP ""45.56.98.222"" that contributes large amount of NDT tests all most every month continiously, and that IP actually registered under to Mlab domain itself? In March 2017's NDT data it contributed 1/3 of all tests.  Then, when we try to associate that Client IP with the Paris traces we found actually traces that have a different IP as destination IP, but last hop reached  ""45.56.98.222"".  For instance, below is an trace takes ""192.189.187.106"" as destination IP but  ""45.56.98.222"" as last hop.  We are particularly interested in understanding this phenomena, because it confuses the algorithm we use to infer inter-domain links from Mlab data in our research work.  If anyone could give some insight and/or pointers to make it clearer to us how to comprehend and hence deal with this case, that'd be highly appreciated.    Here is another traceroute to AS7726: traceroute [(67.106.215.204:33466) -> (192.189.187.106:19439)], protocol icmp, algo exhaustive, duration 31 s  1  P(6, 6) 67.106.215.193.ptr.us.xo.net (67.106.215.193)  0.248/0.263/0.284/0.013 ms   2  P(6, 6) 67.111.23.93.ptr.us.xo.net (67.111.23.93)  0.622/0.730/0.867/0.086 ms   3  P(0, 6)  4  P(6, 6) FEDERAL-EXP.ear3.Denver1.Level3.net (4.14.114.14)  36.417/36.466/36.520/0.037 ms   5  P(6, 6) if-ae-2-2.tcore2.AEQ-Ashburn.as6453.net (216.6.87.1)  56.756/57.231/58.815/0.727 ms     MPLS Label 540091 TTL=1  6  P(6, 6) if-ae-11-2.thar2.NJY-Newark.as6453.net (216.6.87.242)  47.342/47.952/49.564/0.733 ms   7  P(6, 6) 66.198.111.166 (66.198.111.166)  48.158/48.477/49.644/0.526 ms   8  P(6, 6) 173.255.239.1 (173.255.239.1)  0.146/1460.583/4094.052/1491.610 ms   9  P(1, 6) eb.measurementlab.net (45.56.98.222)  0.128/0.128/0.128/0.000 ms  Kind Regards, Xiaohong - Simplicity is not a given.

We appreciate you and your colleagues\' feedback on the new table schema.    Eb.measurementlab.net (45.56.98.222), is part of M-Lab\'s monitoring infrastructure. We run scheduled tests from it to each server on our platform to confirm whether the NDT server is working properly. These tests function as a basic health check, to confirm that NDT is working across the platform end to end. This end to end test has been in place since ~March 2016 and generates 144 tests per server per day.  n regions with a lot of test traffic, this is a minimal amount of data. However, in areas where test volumes are lower, it is likely wise to exclude test results from this IP from your analysis. For the research you\'ve described, we would suggest that you exclude the test results from this IP address. Based on this inquiry our development team has been exploring ways to flag data from this IP so that it can be easily excluded from queries if desired. This will likely be an indicator in the ""blacklist_flag"" field.   Additionally, along with the updates we are planning for table schemas, we are discussing the usefulness of creating pre-defined BigQuery views of the data. For example, this would allow us to define a view for completed NDT tests that met specific parameters for completeness, or to automatically exclude results with the blacklist_flags field set, or to include data only for specific values in the blacklist_flags field. If there are specific views you think would be useful to your research, please let me know.  Lastly, it\'s also worth mentioning that in the immediate future, our development team will be proceeding with a complete rewrite of NDT which will allow us to replace this health check test using a different method that will allow us to monitor the state of each NDT server without adding data to the NDT dataset.  Thanks again, and if you have more questions please let us know  Best regards, Chris    Chris Ritzo  Senior Technologist, Open Technology Institute @ New America  740 15th Street NW, Suite 900  Washington, DC 20036      \ue5d3'}}"

201	enumerating-ndt-servers-/-selecting-a-specific-server	1503457179.0	2017-08-22 19:59:39	rhys.p...@gmail.com	Hello.  A few questions here. First, this is awesome  Is it possible to force a connection to a specific NDT server? It seems to be fully automatic when you go here: https://www.measurementlab.net/tests/ndt/  It would be great to be able to specify what backend server to connect to, as we like to know both the local speed to the closest server, and to say the speed to something close to one of our international data centers.  I've seen some references to peoples specifying servers from the command line tools, but nowhere that has the definitive list of what is available.  I see that you can get the 'closest' server to you by querying: http://mlab-ns.appspot.com/ndt  .. but I can't seem to get the full list of available servers.  I would be okay with resorting to a native application if required.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

I know that they built a Chrome extension that allows selecting the location of the server, but not the provider: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/m-lab-measure/leijmacehibmiomcnpaolboihcdepokh  I thought that selecting both may be useful. I found that all servers are listed on https://mlab-ns.appspot.com/admin/map/ipv4/ndt in the initialize() function in the cities variable.  I built my own interface that allows selecting any combination of location and provider here: https://netperf.tools/#throughput  It\'s just a wrapper around the ndt client JS code.  It has some quirks: * It needs to be updated manually each time the servers change. It would be great if MLab would offer a clean js file with just the servers, assuming that they are open to people using different GUIs for their service, of which I\'m not sure. * It needs to be kept in sync with the official ndt client JS code. This one is more than 1 year old. I don\'t know if anything has changed in the meantime that might affect measurements. * The latency measurement code is completely different from the ndt latency measurement. I measure latency both before the transfers and also during the upload and download, to detect bufferbloat. Last time I checked, the NDT code was measuring latency only during one of the transfers.  I have just updated the server list on the site today; but normally I don\'t do it regularly. If needed I can share the code with you so you can deploy it and maintain it yourself; all that is needed is a static web server.

In the interest of more transparency on those interventions, we have started to maintain a public record on the site. I wanted to call attention to our most recent filing, into the Restoring Internet Freedom docket of the FCC, which is a followup from our past publication and post about interconnection performance. I found it to be an interesting exercise to see the alignment between press releases and the changes in network performance, so hopefully it might encourage others to pick up the data further.  Excerpt:   In this post, we review historical interconnection congestion episodes that appeared to have had a negative impact on consumer broadband and followed how these relationships had changed since the Open Internet Order. Since our last blogpost on interconnection over two years ago, the relationships between operators have changed, resulting in overall improvement in consumer performance and a notable remediation of congestion episodes covered in our initial reports. Often the improvements are sudden, reversing months long underperformance within days. The remediation of congestion parallels an overall improvement across networks in performance for broadband users, and in our analysis we do not find the same patterns of sustained degradation described in past reports.  Full Post: https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/interconnection_update/ Other Regulatory Filings: https://www.measurementlab.net/publications/#government--regulatory-filings  As always, please send me any comments, critiques, or recommendations. We're always interested to hear where we can extend the research or further open up the data to those interested in such topics.   Cordially, Collin Anderson	{}
205	updated-privacy-policy-and-acceptable-use-summary	1502297296.0	2017-08-09 09:48:16	Collin Anderson	Dear M-Lab Discuss List,  As you may have noticed, M-Lab has been in the process of modernizing its technical and non-technical operations in recent months. One of the most common questions we receive from users and collaborators is what measures we take we protect people's privacy and what we do with the measurement data. It's easy to understand why: our policies up to this point have often been arcanely written, scattered across documents, and too brief.   In the interest of more transparency and accessibility, we have updated the Privacy Policy and the Acceptable Use Policy on the M-Lab site. Nothing about the way that M-Lab collects data or the requirements on partners has changed. Instead, this provides what we hope to be an easier to read document that reflects how we operate and provides the basis for reviewing those practices in the future.   Over the next few months, there will be a few more notices as we continue to modernize our policies and documentation. We had shared these drafts for comment with a few members of the community that have previously expressed interest in privacy issues, but we always strive for an open and consultative process around platform operations. If anyone is interested in being included in the process, please feel free to reach out.   Cordially, Collin Anderson	{}

Even worse, the speed you get will also be dependent on where the test server is located, so even the same test can give you different results depending on how far away the test server is - farther servers will tend to give lower results. Note, however, that this far-away server might be giving you a more accurate measurement if the applications you care about are also served from far away.

We know that there is something fishy with the NDT data because IHT runs on top of MLab NDT.  Aside from IHT reporting the maximum of multiple NDT runs, the underlying distributions should be identical, and they clearly aren\'t.  My understanding from my conversations with Steve is that the NDT data was collected using a DIY integration of our NDT client into a runtime environment that we have not tested.  Inspecting the MLab web100 logs suggests that the main runtime event loop only ran the NDT threads once every 16mS.   We are aware of a number of runtime environments that perform extremely poorly.  Several of them seem to block the main event loop on frame rendering.  (The telltale signature: changing display settings sometimes changes the measured performance by exactly 60Hz/70Hz).  We also have the .pcap files for all of the tests in the report, so we can go quite deep in the analysis if we need to.   The other oddity in the data is that the NDT performance is not multi-modal, even though it would be expected to be spread across multiple MLab sites with slightly different RTTs.   The lack of modes very strongly suggests that the bottleneck is local to the client and does not depend on the path at all.   (Nearly all network bottlenecks, except a completely filling a link with zero cross traffic, show some RTT sensitivity).  The client configurations that we do support (and are used in all portals that we are aware of) are routinely subjected to a battery of automated performance and qualification tests.

And this would just be automatic.  Is it possible to do this? Looking further in the site, I am not seeing it.  Maybe I am not an interesting case, as I live in San Jose CA, but on the other hand we have surprising crappy local internet service.  So, anyway. Let me know if the tests can be installed to be run in the background.  thanx - ray	"{0: {'username': 'Ovidiu M', 'response_date': 'May 18, 2017, 12:49:40 AM', 'response_content': 'Ray, I am not involved in the project, but I\'ve used a couple of years ago the NDT command line client available from https://github.com/ndt-project/ndt.

Automated testing is allowed, but we want to make sure people are smart about it. In particular, if enough people naively put ""test every hour on the hour"" into crontab.hourly, then we\'ll end up with a nice DDOS happening every hour on the hour, which would be a bummer for everybody (bad data for the people running tests and bad data put into the MLab results database).  There are several ways one might run the command-line client repeatedly, and which one you want will depend on a bunch of things, including what you want to do with the output. If you want to get the output of your testing by using Google BigQuery (for example, you log your IP address somewhere else and then SELECT all tests in the MLab database that come from one of the IP addresses you have had), then the easiest thing to do is to use the Docker image I cooked up for precisely that purpose.  First install docker (possibly called docker-engine, depending on your linux distribution). Then the command    sudo docker run pboothe/test-runner  will run tests repeatedly, to a random US MLab server, spaced out exponentially-random in time to give you a Poisson distribution of test times. This spacing is a desirable thing from a ""good science"" perspective. The code that makes up that docker image can be found in:   https://github.com/pboothe/mlab-test-runner   If that meets your needs, then do that. The next recommendation is more painful and requires you to understand more things:  If you want to do something more custom with the output, then you should install the ndt command-line client and then drop an entry into cron.hourly or cron.daily to run that client. In both cases, please add some jitter to the start time.  For cron.daily, it would be nice if, prior to the test command, you added    sleep $[ ${RANDOM} % (24*60*60) ];  which will sleep for a random number of seconds (but no more than a day\'s worth) before running the test.  For cron.hourly, do   sleep $[ ${RANDOM} % (60*60) ]; if you are running one of those custom crons that supports randomness, just use that.  If you don\'t want to hard-code the servername to connect to, you can do the following to get a random server that is online and chosen from the set of servers geographically closest to you:   curl mlab-ns.appspot.com/ndt | sed -e \'s/.*fqdn"": ""//\' -e \'s/"".*//\'  Putting this all together, I\'d recommend putting:   sleep $[ ${RANDOM} % (60*60) ]; SERVER=$(curl --silent mlab-ns.appspot.com/ndt | sed -e \'s/.*fqdn"": ""//\' -e \'s/"".*//\'); ./web100clt --name=${SERVER} --port=3001 > /tmp/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S).${SERVER}.ndtresult  in your cron.hourly to test hourly. This will cause a timestamped series of files to appear in /tmp, and then you can do with those files whatever you want.  Hopefully, the answers you need can be found in this long-winded explanation.

213	m-lab-update-on-paris-traceroute-issues-and-resolution	1491930278.0	2017-04-11 10:04:38	Chris Ritzo	Greetings all:  In February 2017, M-Lab was notified of issues with the M-Lab data available in BigQuery. Upon investigation, a problem was identified with the Paris Traceroute collection daemon which resulted in a reduction in Paris Traceroute measurements beginning in June 2016. At the peak of the outage, fourth quarter 2016 - January 2017, approximately 5% of NDT tests had an associated Paris Traceroute test. Additionally, an issue within the data processing pipeline resulted in Paris Traceroute data that was measured and collected, not being inserted into the BigQuery tables and therefore available for use.  Both defects were resolved in mid-February, additional monitoring was added, and BigQuery has been brought up to date with the available data.   For complete details on this issue and resolutions put into place, please read our recently published blog post on the event.  Best, Chris   Chris Ritzo  Senior Technologist, Open Technology Institute @ New America  740 15th Street NW, Suite 900  Washington, DC 20036     	{}

But it doesn\'t allow save as CSV file because the records are too many.  Even by trunk the time to five minutes time granularity, it returns 11,142 which prevents to download as CSV. So it suggests to save as Table, but when I tired, it says I didn\'t have access to create tables.   The aim here is to  query a substantial amount of PT data to process.Preferably one month US data. What would you suggest might work?

We will also post about it on our blog.   In the interim, knowing that researchers may be working on conference or writing deadlines, we also will post an example for parsing the Paris Traceroute raw format data as soon as we can. If you have a pressing deadline please reply here or reply to me off-list so to help the team prioritize.  Lastly, specific to your last note, Xiaohong, it sounds like you are using the BigQuery web interface to run queries and download CSV results. This normally works fine for most uses, but as you've noted, when the results are particularly large the CSV download is not available on the web. Two options come to mind that would help get around this.   First, if you are able to install and use the Google Cloud SDK, you can use the BigQuery command line tools to run queries and save the output directly as CSV or JSON. See the documentation on our site for installing and using the Gcloud SDK. If you run into issues installing or using, please let me know and I can support you.   Second, if you use R or R studio, there is a BigQuery package available, bigrquery. I have found this package useful in my own work, as it allows you to save queries as text files and import results directly into dataframes. I'm a relative novice at R, but I'm happy to talk with any other R users who might want to explore this option.  Thanks everyone, and we will be in touch on list with more information as we have it.

I managed to put together BigQuery APIs with Python code. And as my google account is whitelisted by Bigquery, when I run python code on my own Mac, it pops up a Web interface requiring me input my google account credentials. After input, It works fine.  But now I need copy this set up to a Linux server to which I only have ssh access. So I wonder is there a way to embed my credentials with ""client_secrets.json""? Could not find associated manual to do so.  There seems two fields relevant:  auth_uri"":""https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"" and ""client_email"":ï¼ but not a field that I can embed a password with and avoid being redirected to autentification URL? because from a ssh session I don\'t have access to pop up browser.  p.s Would be nice you can put a R query example sometime in future.

Additionally, and as relates to the inquiries of others on the large number of results in the PT data, I\'ve re-run your query within my RStudio project to see where I run into query resource limits. Using the query below, I\'ve been able to use the rbigquery package to get ~1/2 day of data at a time without hitting resource limits:  SELECT   STRFTIME_UTC_USEC((INTEGER(log_time) * 1000000), \'%Y-%m-%d %T\') AS UTC_date_time,    test_id, connection_spec.client_ip, connection_spec.server_ip,    paris_traceroute_hop.src_ip, paris_traceroute_hop.dest_ip,    paris_traceroute_hop.src_hostname, paris_traceroute_hop.dest_hostname  FROM   [plx.google:m_lab.paris_traceroute.all] WHERE   project = 3   AND IS_EXPLICITLY_DEFINED(paris_traceroute_hop.src_ip)   AND connection_spec.server_geolocation.country_code = \'US\'   AND ((log_time >= PARSE_UTC_USEC(""2016-06-01 12:00:00"") / POW(10, 6))   AND (log_time < PARSE_UTC_USEC(""2016-06-01 23:59:59"") / POW(10, 6))) ORDER BY test_id DESC  This is obviously not ideal for gathering large amounts of data, but as Peter mentioned, we hope to soon have our tables updated so that these resource limits will no longer affect us in this way. As a workaround, however, I\'ll be adding an example to my RStudio project repo, some R code that can be used to run subsequent queries and append them to the same data frame.  Hope this helps.

216	variability-in-results	1487758773.0	2017-02-22 03:19:33	Jerry Helffrich	I just began using the m-lab site for speed testing tonight, but I'm struck by how much variation there is in the results taken just 30 seconds apart. I began getting 6 Mbps down and 1 Mbps up (this is a DSL connection) and after 4 successive tries I steadily went down to 1 Mbps down and 0.4 Mbls up. Not only are the numbers depressing in the absolute sense, but these tests are being done at 3:30 AM CST, when I would expect congestion and latency to be at their minimums--and the connection is being made from San Antonio to DFW, which I'm guessing is the Dallas Fort Worth airport. So, is there any reason (buffer filling?) that my speed should steadily go down when testing at 30 second intervals? If this is normal, which number is the correct one? A factor of six variation in download speed is a lot.Results summary below: TCP receive window: 317856 current, 317856 maximum 0.10 % of packets lost during test Round trip time: 27 msec (minimum), 1128 msec (maximum), 409 msec (average) Jitter: - 0.00 seconds spend waiting following a timeout TCP time-out counter: 894 332 selective acknowledgement packets received  No duplex mismatch condition was detected. The test did not detect a cable fault. No network congestion was detected.  0.8043 % of the time was not spent in a receiver limited or sender limited state. 0.1468 % of the time the connection is limited by the client machine's receive buffer. Optimal receive buffer: - bytes Bottleneck link: - 333 duplicate ACKs set	{}

I obviously have access to the MLab data because when I include a table (such as plx.google:m_lab.ndt.all) in a query, it works as expected.  From what I can see however, I can't actually browse the tables as they do not appear in the datasets on the left of the screen.  Am I doing something wrong?  Or do we not have access to browse the tables?  It would be good to be able to browse the tables to get familiar with the data.

Specifically when running the NDT performance test.  Also, there are a lot of perfsonar servers run by R&E networks, which also employ the NDT test. Is there an effort to collect result log data from those servers and make them available to the m-lab dataset?  ...Ron	"{0: {'username': 'Collin Anderson', 'response_date': 'Jan 30, 2017, 11:54:27 AM', 'response_content': 'Hi Ron,  In most NDT clients associated with M-Lab, the selection will be based on determining the physically-closest site to the user based on IP geolocation services. M-Lab provides the mlab-ns service in order to facilitate this pairing. However, if another client or integration would like to use an alternative approach, they are welcome to do so. So its based on which deployment of NDT you are using, but I would assume physically-closest is the answer.  M-Lab does not include data collected perfsonar servers. We would certainly be open to provide comparison, and our primary limitation to including the data in our general datasets is that we are concerned about the conditions and capabilities under which tests are performed. As a result, we have been shifting toward more standardization in the fleet, and more rigorous qualification of M-Lab sites. Hence, it would be important to differentiate those to datasets in any form of comparison (not to dismiss perfsonar in any manner of course, only a communications challenge).
