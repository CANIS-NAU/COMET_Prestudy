This is very helpful. I just have a few more questions about determining cell tower coverage. I assume you mean that I can use the radio type (e.g., UMTS, GSM) to determine the radio frequencies that each radio uses, and from there determine the approximate distance that the frequencies would attenuate in a flat terrain. However, after reading up more on each radio type, I realize that they each use a wide range of frequencies, so the attenuation would also be wide ranging for each tower.

275	cid-data-for-cdma	ndamenti	1545349628.174	2018-12-20 16:47:08	I’ve got a question about the context of the CID field for CDMA records.  I was looking at Sprint data that I extracted.  Here’s a snapshot of the CDMA data (see below).  Here’s my question.  Does the CID for CDMA in the OpenCellID database represent a unique BTS or is it a cell sector?  For example, when I extract LTE data from the OpenCellID database the CID is a unique sector identifier.  It’s clear that for the LTE data one can take the CID and do a shift right by 8 bits to extract the corresponding eNB.  For this CDMA data, I really can’t tell if there’s a unique BTS embedded within the CID for if the CID actually represents a unique BTS.  Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I struggled and research a lot when I was studying about the network data and especially the database provided by the OpenCellID. I found this platform very useful because Mr Sagar, who is the Leader here, is very active in responding to the queries. I have learnt through this forum by reading almost all the threads and the answers provided by Mr Sagar. I am very thankful to the community for posting the inquiries (which benefited me) and to Mr Sagar for quick responses on all the threads. Therefore, I believe its time to payback and provide benefit to the community through the research I have recently produced on IEEE journal. What basics you will learn from this research article? 1- Mathematical description of the OpenCellID database 2- Explanation of LTE identifiers to understand the database What secondary things you will learn from this article? 3- Data selection and extraction procedure 4- How to identify the unique cells 5- How to visualize the data points I hope you will all find this helpful in your work or research in some way beneficial for society. I am putting the link of my article below from the IEEE, and it is open access so everyone can read and download the article.

I am doing a research on this as well.\nAs for LAC, it is always keep large however certain times it will be smaller. This is dependent on traffic pattern. If loading is high it is wiser to keep it small as lots of location updates occur especially at the border.

Nice community!\nI am doing a research in Brazil, and I need to associate the area codes with the mobile operator (MNO or MVNO) and the MCC-MNC for that specific operator. I know that you can find a MCC-MNC list in Wikipedia, but I still cannot associate the MNC to each code, basically because:\n1.- There are some carriers that have multiple MNCs, so I don’t know how to match area code with each MNC.\n2.- There are some MVNOs (CUBIC, NLT, Americanet, etc.) that do not have a MNC explicitly assigned but do have assigned area codes for them, so I suppose they use the same MNC as the carrier that provides the network (TIM, VIVO, etc.). However, if the carrier has multiple MNCs, I don’t know how to pair those area codes with the MNCs.\nI hope I could explain myself. Thank you in advance'}}

8	welcome-to-the-opencellid-community	system	1493859615.06	2017-05-03 18:00:15	Hello! There have been a few exciting changes at OpenCelliD over the past few weeks and I’m here to update you about it. Markus Semm, the man who built and brought OpenCelliD to where it is today, has transferred its maintainership responsibilities to Unwired Labs. In the past few years, OpenCelliD was funded by Markus’ personal funds and he’s taken care of all the development and infrastructure efforts and have single-handedly cleaned up the datasets and made it a reliable source. He believed it was time for it to grow further under a new custodian. Who are we? Unwired Labs is a leading geolocation company that specialises in Cell-tower & WiFi based positioning. We’ve been around for 4 years, but in this short while, we’ve rapidly built our partnership networks for data, helped thousands of developers/ startups create better products. How is it going to help? We believe in open-source and realize that it is a major contributor to geolocation services. We aim to improve OCIDs datasets, modernize its infrastructure and take it towards becoming a major open-source dataset for Cell, WiFi, IoT Wide area Networks. Unwired is entirely focused on geolocation, so it gives us incentive to share our resources and support the community. What does this mean for you? Better data that provides your apps and devices better locations! Also, you won’t have to worry about having to adapt to anything new. All the changes will happen at our end. Your contributions and tokens will stay intact and you will be able to download the database and request removal of your data - just like it was before. We will make sure the transition is smooth. Most importantly it stays open! We’re really proud and excited to have been handed over this responsibility and are very excited to work with the community!  Onward, Gopi Aravind	{963: {'username': 'Machinef', 'date_epoch': 1625765876.849, 'date_ymd': '2021-07-08 10:37:56', 'content': 'That is terrific people helping  people  move forward and onward with the best of intentions may the torch stay lit'}}

I’ll share a couple of thoughts on some of the frequently asked questions - I’ll keep adding to the list. You can put down your queries in the comments. How is OpenCelliD.org benefiting out of it?  We plan to transform OpenCellID into an open-source database hub for Cell, WiFi, LPWAN and more. We already have the resources in place to offer technological expertise and community support.  What have we done so far?  We’ve revamped and modernized the entire infrastructure We’ve added strict data verification process in place We’ve added a new user dashboard We’ve added reporting features We’ve added Maps/ Geocoding (in a minor way) - We’ll launch it in a major way soon We’ve added active support policies in place - and are actively responding to all support queries within 12 hours  Will I be able to download the cells csv data?  Yes. Head over to www.opencellid.org/downloads   What will happen to my contributions?  They are yours, you will have the ability to contribute, download the database and request removal of your data - just like it was before.  How is Unwired labs benefiting out of it?  Geolocation also happens to be our core product at Unwired. It is heavily powered by crowd-sourced data. By maintaining and growing OCID, we hope to provide better location for everyone. Our bread and butter, as always, will be from Enterprises paying for proprietary data, higher limits/ second, on-premise hosting and priority support.  What’s your privacy policy like?  The data you contribute to OpenCellID is yours, the data contributed by the community will be available to download.  What are the differences between Unwired and OpenCelliD datasets  Unwired Labs’ datasets include proprietary data.  Are you selling my data for marketing purposes?  No.  What will happen to my old OpenCelliD token?  Your token is yours and will not change, we’ve integrated it into our systems. You can check out your dashboard here   How can I help?  If you are a developer, you can help the community by building simple apps that will expand OpenCellID datasets If you’re a user, you can install our android app, contribute and compete If you can’t contribute data, help us improve; give us feedback, spread the word and help others benefit out of this 	{405: {'username': 'Max', 'date_epoch': 1539385779.07, 'date_ymd': '2018-10-12 16:09:39', 'content': 'Hi there, I’d really like to contribute to your database, given I’m working in Ivory Coast for the coming 2,5 month and your database in the countryside could be improved.

I want to know where he is living, so I isolated only record from night hours and now I have a list of 6 antennas. I thought about three options for choosing this specific area. The first, choose the antenna with the most record and mark the area circling the antenna and maybe only 120 degrees according to its azimuth. The second, draw a polygon around all antennas and this will be the area, The third. find the mean of all antennas location with weights(# of records of each antenna) and according to this, this will be the right location. What do you think? which one will be the right way or just more accurate? I have no ground truth to check this out?

330	beginner-questions-on-how-to-participate	rd5638	1559462884.767	2019-06-02 01:08:04	Having just gotten my first smartphone a few months ago, I’m now trying to learn the process of determining which tower its connecting to, and its physical location. It seems the two main worlds are MLS/OpenCelliD/Unwired Labs, here, and CellMapper.net. To actively participate I see that I need the Tower Collector app to submit to this project, and CellMapper’s app to submit to them. Am I correct in noting that one big difference between these two projects is that participants in CellMapper can manually adjust the locations of known towers, while here machine algorithms alone determine the towers locations? In other words, Cellmapper has its red vs. green notation for estimated vs. known location, while here there is only some sort of accuracy range? Some preliminary comparisons show that CellMapper’s greens are truly accurate, and their reds are in the general ballbark, while this project’s locations seem more like where the tester is reporting from than the actual cell transmitter. With CellMapper I can see there is a way to correct their inaccurate locations, but what can I do here? E.g., for an OpenCelliD entry for a building mounted antenna near a freeway, it seems that many data samples have come from on the freeway, but maybe none from the roads around the building. What could I do to nudge the location away from the freeway back to the building itself?	{577: {'username': 'rd5638', 'date_epoch': 1559892330.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-06-07 00:25:30', 'content': 'More detail about what I’m asking.\nI’m not going to root my phone, nor so I have engineering screens that give me super detailled info from the modem.

For tower sites along a freeway, this means figuring out the surface streets on both the side with the tower, and across the freeway on the other side.  This takes some planning, and being careful to only have the collector app running at the appropriate times.\nWhat I’m wondering is if the readings while on the “behind” side of the tower will be used to compute the actual location of the tower.\nIn other words, will all the effort to collect readings all around the tower help make the reported location more accurate?\nAnd, if fewer people do this, than those who just drive along the freeway, does the algorithm have any way of compensating?'}, 952: {'username': 'proft', 'date_epoch': 1624838399.213, 'date_ymd': '2021-06-27 16:59:59', 'content': 'Therein lies the problem with both projects.

The fact that pretty much only inaccurate OpenCellID data is used by most apps makes this problem even worse.'}}

318	process-logic-for-aggregating-cells-into-towers-they-share	William_Pence	1556398663.095	2019-04-27 13:57:43	Hello! I am interested in creating an algorithm to use this data to create a fairly reliable database of actual tower/antenna geo coordinates. In looking through the data and the map visualizations, it is clear that the triangulation method used introduces some inherent position error - I believe I read that in some rare cases it can be as much as 100-200m. Understanding that many of the cells in this database which appear within 100m or so of each other probably share the same tower, would it be reasonable to assume that an algorithm which aggregated all cells within 100m of each other, and perhaps choosing the centroid of their coordinates as the approximate location of the tower, would be a reasonable approach for rural and suburban areas in the US? I realize this would not likely work in dense urban environments. Is it also safe to assume that if a cell appears in the data and is widely separated from other cells in the database (let’s say more than 200m) that the cell is really present and is not a false positive? I ask because I see cells on the map in our area that do not appear to be present when I visit the location. So I assume either 1) a false positive based on bad readings or triangulation errors, or 2) an antenna/cell which is actually present in that approximate location, but is hidden (building, etc.).

636	desperate-help-needed-likely-phone-hacked	gerrykc	1631080924.103	2021-09-07 23:02:04	Hi there - So I am a victim of major cyber crime - extremely sophisticated group stole my entire identity and every account, device, etc. associated with me and have used my identity to pursue highly lucrative illegal actions in my name - law enforcement legal, cyber experts involved etc. However, I’m a “persistent target” as they need continued access to my identity. Sorry - for the long explanation, but it’s like out of a movie and turned my life upside down. I’ve been lacking in support around how the phone “device” (phones - I’m on number 4) seem to be part of the continuous breaches/penetration stifling everyone. I am receiving so much cyber help, I’m trying to see what I can do to potentially confirm and address that I have come to believe that my devices themselves are part of the nightmare too. I notice odd phone behavior all the time, but that is just my reality now - until specialized units in law enforcement/law someday hopefully shut this down (I’m one of many victims). As I think that this may not all be viral but all the odd behavior is instead representative of breached devices. So I am seeking serious help because Verizon didn’t seem to know what I was talking about regarding help re: my phone itself being cloned, highjacked, sim stolen, tokens and APIs etc. I checked your site and I have one API token allowed on my plan, and it has been used. Forgive my ignorance, but I have no idea if this is normal or if the fact that I had nothing to do with this token is concerning. I just found a token that was visible in my iphone settongs but has immediately disappeared. I do know that heavy traffic by the cyber criminals have been identified on various API websites re: data manipulation/access, but re. phones has never come up. So I apologize, but I am trying to find out if the fact that my phone has an API/token that I have had nothing to do with is a sign that my phone itself is being used, as well, as a source of stealing my identity/data and if so, how is the best way to handle/respond to the API/token/sim without causing further exposure, losing data/information or damaging this most recent phone. (Additionally, any advice on how to protect my phone itself moving forward - advanced suggestions both because despite my ignorance here I’m very secure and follow text book+ recomendation, in addition ti the fact that they are engineers and basically geniuses that stifle all involved in their capabilities - e.g. I was initially infected by embedded code in emails from a trusted company itself hacked and used to reach its consumers and they currently use existing os access point vulnerabilities to assume remote access). Thank you so much!	{}
580	documentation-for-5g-values	mt4	1624577995.387	2021-06-24 16:39:55	I was wondering if there is any documentation on the values for cell and unit in the download file, specifically for the 5G (NR) entries.  What values area actually being reported in these fields (ie. LocalCellID, NRCellID, something else)?  I’ve seen the table on the wiki, but it doesn’t breakdown the values according to the different technologies. I have noticed that currently about 25% of the entries with a radio value of “NR” have a cell value of 2147483647. This is fairly suspicious since that is the largest positive value for a 32-bit signed integer, and usually indicates that a system has attempted to store a larger integer into a 32-bit variable.  There are also a number of other values in the cell column which are much higher (12 digits) than even the max value for a 36-bit integer (which is what the NRCellID should be). I am curious if these are just artifacts of providers doing testing, or if there is some other type of value that is being put into the cell column.	{978: {'username': 'rgrindley', 'date_epoch': 1627127245.373, 'date_ymd': '2021-07-24 04:47:25', 'content': 'Also how to differentiate between 5G NSA (ie voice channel is LTE, data channel NR) and 5G SA (both voice and data channels are NR).'}, 979: {'username': 'adamzamojski', 'date_epoch': 1627474140.688, 'date_ymd': '2021-07-28 05:09:00', 'content': 'The max 32-bit integer value indicates that the value was not available.

I have a VIVO Y71, and it does not seem to perform as well as my previous Samsung J7. I’m in the same location, so I’m wondering if there is a simple DIY method to improve a phone’s reception.   does anyone know how to locate exact cell towers that provide coverage for specific networks?  I used to know an amazing Department Of Telecommunications of India website that had excellent information available, but right now I can’t find it again…   any ideas how to improve performance of specific apps like WhatsApp?   Thanks very much: to anyone who is able to contribute, I really appreciate it.	{451: {'username': 'Sagar', 'date_epoch': 1546271657.549, 'date_ymd': '2018-12-31 08:54:17', 'content': 'Hey Rajneesh,\nI’m afraid there isn’t much we can do about questions 1 & 3.

As I understand it, OpenCellID data is created from open source or, in other words, user-submitted, data. For this reason, I suspect that it does not capture ALL of the cells in the world, but perhaps it’s fairly good in the US (e.g. captures 85% of all cells). Is there any documentation on how “good” OpenCellID data is? How close does it get to capturing all cells? Does its accuracy vary in certain, known conditions? E.g. OpenCellID is gold in urban areas, like NYC, but, because there aren’t many contributors in, say, rural Wyoming, it’s not particularly useful there. Is there a way to derive this (or a related) measure from the number of reports (read: the “sample” variable in the data) and its date of first sampling (read: “created” variable in the data).

No answer for you yet on that one, though I suspect may have something to do with seniority on the forum.\nThe OpenCellID data is derived from measurements. The signal strength of those measurements can be affected by many things, not all of which the subsequent calculations to determine tower location would be aware of.

This is true for any crowd-sourced data.\nAs I understand it, the OpenCellID data identifies cells, not just towers. A tower may have multiple cells from each service provider, and each tower may have multiple service providers. So there could be many cells from one tower, and not all those cells will be pinned to the same location since there is a significant error margin.\nAlso, from having examined some of the data, it appears that old cells no longer active may continue to reside in the database, which I can understand, since not easy to determine whether a previously reported cell is still active.\nFor example, an older UMTS cell with a specific cell ID on a specific frequency may be re-assigned with a different cell ID or shut down altogether to allow for the frequency to be re-farmed.

Assuming “created” can be used as a proxy for the date the cell was installed by the telco operator, any precautions in using this data to track number of cells by operator over time?

Also, there is a UNIX time stamp in the database which you can utilized to see when the samples from the corresponding cells are recorded.\n\n\nThe precaution that you should take care of is to handle the redundancy in this raw database.

First, they may be installed before and then may be upgraded to the new RAT in view of the required capacity or coverage.

Apologies in advance about this question–I’m very much a novice for working with cellular data, but hoping that I can obtain from OpenCelliD data for my masters thesis project. I’m interested in putting together a dataset of mobile network coverage by carrier for multiple countries, across several years. So in my mind the dataset would have, for each sub-unit (GADM level 2, i.e. County/district/equivalent, or ideally even smaller) within a country the mobile carriers that are present in that area (and perhaps even some estimate of the area they cover) in that year (or even better, for each month or week). Ideally I would have this data back to 2010, but even a few years would be great. Would it be possible to put together such a dataset from data I can download from OpenCelliD? From my (novice) reading of this website it seems that I can download data that includes cell towers (with their lat/long locations) and the carriers on each tower, which I could easily aggregate up into the panel dataset I described above. But is this correct? And if so, any tips on putting this dataset together (or even better, hints on where this dataset might already exist ) ?

I was wondering what does numbers such as 16462, 16408, 22, 61, 16384 etc. mean if they are not actual MNCs?	{1128: {'username': 'MobileM', 'date_epoch': 1633569323.438, 'date_ymd': '2021-10-06 18:15:23', 'content': 'Hi ShanJaffry,\n\n\n\n ShanJaffry:\n\nI am in Canada and according the OpenCelliD data following are the MNC\n\n\nHow did you determine these were the MNCs according to the data?\n\n\n\n ShanJaffry:\n\naccording to official data, MNCs start from 100 and end at 998.\n\n\nWhere did you get this information from?'}}

The Wikipedia page states:  mobile network code consists of two or three decimal digits (for example: MNC of 001 is not the same as MNC of 01)  However, when I look at the net column of a OpenCelliD CSV file, I see MNC codes that are just one digit long, and no MNC codes that start with a 0. It seems these are handled as integers instead of as 2- or 3-digit identifiers where leading zeroes matter. Thus, my question: what is going on? Is the Wikipedia page wrong? Or is the data in the CSV incorrectly removing leading zeroes, thus grouping different MNC’s together? Or is Wikipedia only “technically” correct but in are there no such MNC’s in the real world where the leading zeroes matter?	{}

Long story short, it has led to extreme stalking and harassment by our neighbors and a vindictive ex-girlfriend. From all the outrageous and malicious events that have taken place, we’re very concerned what the endgame is.  Seeing as law enforcement has been sent to my house on 4 separate occasions I can only assume that crimes or something are being committed in my name and it’s stemming from my cell phones.  it’s only getting creepier and more concerning.  I’m begging for someone to take the time to help me understand how this keeps happening and whats going on. I can’t keep purchasing new phones.  I downloaded the SpyCatcher app and it looks like i keep connecting to unknown networks at my neighbors house.  The OpenCellId site is now updated with 5 “cell towers” that looks to be in my neighbors house, set to the same parameters as a real cell tower down the street, except everyday the timestamps will be updated to a future time.  Something very sinister is happening and Im hoping this site and this community can help me understand and put an end to this unbelievable nightmare.  Is there something else im picking up on, like boosters or something, that OpenCellID is updating as cell towers, or are my neighbors using an IMSI catcher or something right next door to me?  That would explain why this vicious circle has been going on for the past year.  Please, someone out there has to have knowledge about cellular towers and if my community really  is being that malicious I hope that there’s a way to prove IMSI catchers are being illegally used to continuously compromise my family’s devices.  Thank you all for your time and consideration.  I feel grateful that there’s a community like this because not even the cell phone companies seem to know how cellular networks operate.	{1506: {'username': 'chipechop', 'date_epoch': 1646325685.569, 'date_ymd': '2022-03-03 09:41:25', 'content': 'In my country, Police has a specific team that deals with telecommunications crimes.

934	lte-cells-above-the-water	JuaneGC	1650920290.906	2022-04-25 13:58:10	Hello! A few weeks ago I download the CSV file from Hong Kong to do some university stuffs. You cannot imagine my surprise when I realised there were a lot of stations (GSM, UMTS and LTE) above the water. I’ve never been there so I don’t know if it’s real data or, maybe, it is a position issue. I’ve been looking for information on the Internet but I’m not able to find an answer. I hope someone could help me in this. Thank you so much!	{}
