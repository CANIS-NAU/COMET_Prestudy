First of all, this tool is awesome!<br>\nWhen I search a cell tower with MCC, MNC, LAC and CID,  then mapa shows an area with red flags with “G”, corresponding  to a GSM antenna, and several flags with “U”. What does “U” flags means? And how accurate is the “Range”?<br>\nThanks!</p>', 'date': '2022-03-15T11:34:23.920Z'}, 1614: {'username': 'chipechop', 'content': '<p>G = GSM (2G network)<br>\nU = UMTS (3G network)<br>\nL = LTE (4G network)</p>\n<p>See: <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_phone_generations"" class=""inline-onebox"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">List of mobile phone generations - Wikipedia</a></p>', 'date': '2022-05-11T06:39:28.459Z'}}"
