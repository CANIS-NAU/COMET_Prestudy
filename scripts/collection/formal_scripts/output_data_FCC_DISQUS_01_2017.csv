0	The Grand Finale	Ajit Pai	2020-12-23 12:25:00	1608751500.0	Serving as Chairman of the FCC has been the honor of a lifetime. And soon, my time in this position will conclude. You may have seen my announcement last month that I‚Äôll be departing the Commission on January 20, 2021. As those who follow the agency know, setting the agenda for and presiding over our monthly meetings is among the key responsibilities of my role. Three weeks from today, I‚Äôll preside over my 49th ‚Äî and final ‚Äî meeting. Before outlining the agenda for that meeting, a few words about its 48 most recent predecessors. The FCC‚Äôs monthly meetings showcase the agency‚Äôs highest-profile work. And by any metric, we have been more productive, more collaborative, and more transparent since January 2017 than at any time in recent history. At the 48 meetings held under my leadership, we‚Äôve voted on a total of 286 items ‚Äî an average of six (5.96, to be precise) items per meeting. That compares to a recent historical average of well under three. Of the votes on those 286 items, 205 (71.7%) featured no dissents and 253 (88.5%) were bipartisan. These figures are far higher than comparable figures from the four preceding years. On top of all this, we‚Äôve introduced unprecedented transparency into the process. As a Commissioner, I‚Äôd long called for the agency to ‚Äúshow its work‚Äù ‚Äî to share with the American public what the FCC would be voting on before we actually voted. In my second week in office, I made this good-government reform happen. It‚Äôs now routine for the agency to publish the exact text of Commission meeting items three weeks in advance of any votes being cast; to include a one-page fact sheet describing in plain English what each item does; and to post a monthly blog from yours truly introducing the agenda in a hopefully-engaging way. Bottom line: This FCC has been working hard, working collaboratively, and working openly to deliver results for the American people. After a wonderful four years, we will soon arrive at the denouement ‚Äî the FCC‚Äôs January 2021 meeting. This meeting will be different from all that have come before during my time. As you know, the FCC‚Äôs staff has done amazing work over the past four years ‚Äî work that‚Äôs contributed to the eye-popping statistics above. Since 2017, I‚Äôve seen many, many times how hard and well they‚Äôve worked ‚Äî across Bureaus and Offices, across disciplines, and even across the country. In order to give them the recognition they‚Äôre due and to let them share with you the results they‚Äôve achieved, I have asked FCC Bureaus, Offices, and Task Forces to prepare presentations highlighting their most significant accomplishments over the past four years. It‚Äôs been a privilege to work alongside these outstanding public servants. Three weeks hence, the spotlight properly should shine on them. Until then, I want to take this moment to thank everyone for sharing this journey with me, especially my family. I want to express how grateful I am to my colleagues, including the 1,400-plus staff I‚Äôve had the honor to lead. And I want to wish all of you a safe and happy holiday season. I look forward to seeing you in the New Year.

1	To Safe and Secure Holidays... and Networks	Ajit Pai	2020-11-18 14:55:00	1605736500.0	Every month, I use this platform to tout the items on the FCC‚Äôs upcoming monthly meeting agenda and explain how they will help to address key challenges facing our country.  For our December 2020 meeting, it‚Äôs not just me saying that the Commission is dealing with some heady issues.  Last week, National Security Advisor Robert O‚ÄôBrien gave an interview in which he said the ‚Äúnumber one concern‚Äù for democracy at home and abroad is the integrity of our communications networks.  In particular, he warned that installing equipment from Chinese firms in the backbone of our 5G networks could give the Communist Chinese government ‚Äúbackdoors to pull up every bit of data in the world.‚Äù I agree wholeheartedly. Or, as I‚Äôm fond of quipping on Twitter, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt say.‚Äù  The FCC recognizes this threat and has taken a series of actions to secure the integrity of the communications supply chain.  Specifically, the FCC voted to prohibit the use of money from our Universal Service Fund to purchase or obtain any equipment or services produced or provided by companies posing a national security threat, including the world‚Äôs largest global 5G supplier‚ÄîHuawei.  We also started a process to identify and catalog insecure equipment used in USF-funded communications networks, with an eye to implementing a program to remove and replace it.  More recently, we hosted a forum on Open Radio Access Networks, or Open RANs, which could transform 5G network architecture, costs, and security. This December, the Commission will have the opportunity to build on this progress and take critical next steps toward securing our communications networks.  We will be voting on an Order implementing the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019.  These new rules would establish the procedures and criteria for publishing a list of the communications equipment and services that pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.  They would then require eligible telecommunications carriers to remove and replace such equipment from their networks, and would establish the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program to subsidize smaller carriers to remove and replace such equipment.  Moreover, to ensure we are informed about the ongoing presence of insecure equipment in communications networks, the rules would also mandate strict reporting requirements. Our December agenda will feature two additional national security matters, which I am unable to discuss in detail at this time.    Just as the Commission wants to stop the deployment of technologies that could undermine the security of our communications networks, we want to accelerate the development of new technologies that could help grow our economy and improve our quality of life.  Every day, pretty much every American uses multiple devices or gadgets that were approved through the FCC‚Äôs equipment authorization program, whether it‚Äôs your cellphone, your laptop, or your Wi-Fi router.  This authorization process offers consumers assurance that their devices will work as intended and operate free from harmful interference.    As the pace of innovation has increased in the Internet age and product development cycles have accelerated, our equipment authorization rules in some ways have failed to keep pace.  In particular, our rules limit the ability of device manufacturers to market and import radiofrequency devices in the most efficient and cost-effective ways possible.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proposing targeted enhancements to our equipment authorization rules to make sure the newest technologies and must-have devices reach consumers as quickly as possible while still meeting our substantive standards.   Next up on our December agenda is a proposal to encourage the deployment of services using ATSC 3.0‚Äîthe ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù broadcast television standard.  The rollout of ATSC 3.0 is well under way, with stations in a dozen markets licensed to transmit in this new standard, and twenty ATSC 3.0 compatible televisions set to be available for sale this year.  The new standard promises to finally realize the potential for broadcast spectrum capacity to support so-called ‚ÄúBroadcast Internet‚Äù services‚Äîdigital services beyond traditional over-the-air video, integrated into the broadband ecosystem.  This December, the Commission will vote on a Report and Order that clarifies and updates the regulatory landscape in order to foster the efficient and robust use of broadcast spectrum capacity for the provision of such services.  Specifically, it clarifies the basis on which to calculate ancillary and supplementary service fees, which are an assessment on the revenues earned by television stations from such services that we are required by statute to collect.  It also retains the existing standard of derogation of broadcast service, while amending the rule to eliminate an outdated reference to analog television.  And although the Report and Order generally declines at this time to adjust the 5% fee imposed on ancillary and supplementary services, it does lower the fee to 2.5% for noncommercial educational stations, which are uniquely positioned to take full advantage of the possibilities of Broadcast Internet, for nonprofit, noncommercial, educational services. With Thanksgiving around the corner, it‚Äôs only fitting that I conclude by thanking all the staff who have worked on these items.  More broadly, I will be forever grateful to all the members of the FCC family who have gone above and beyond to serve the American people in unprecedented conditions during an unforgettable year.  Here‚Äôs wishing my colleagues and all of you a Happy Thanksgiving.

2	Celebrating 100 Years of Commercial Radio	Michelle Carey	2020-11-02 12:35:00	1604345700.0	Today we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first widely recognized commercial radio broadcast that took place on November 2, 1920.  Radio was the earliest electronic mass communications medium.  It provided previously unimagined instant breaking news and entertainment, all in the comfort of one‚Äôs home.  Radio‚Äôs underlying technology also paved the way for future innovations in wireless communications, such as televisions and mobile phones.  Let‚Äôs celebrate this special occasion by looking back at the impact of radio in the United States this past century. What do these people have in common:  David Letterman; Oprah Winfrey; Jimmy Kimmel; Howard Stern; and Ryan Seacrest?  All of them started their careers in broadcast radio.  Radio has held a special place in many peoples‚Äô lives.  Some of my earliest memories involve listening to Paul Harvey delivering the news as we drove to the beach each summer, eagerly awaiting the most popular songs on Casey Kasem‚Äôs American Top 40 countdown, and being riveted by Sally Jessy Raphael‚Äôs call-in advice show.  These radio personalities, and others like them, did not just offer news and entertainment, they became embedded in the fabric of American life.  Radio has the power to unify.  This is especially true during the pandemic.  It makes many people feel less alone knowing that they are listening to the same show along with their family, friends, and neighbors.  So how did this transformative technology get its start?  Let‚Äôs take a look back over radio‚Äôs century-long history, beginning at the time when it was considered a novel experimental technology. Established by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, KDKA is widely recognized as the first commercial radio station.  Westinghouse used vacuum tube transmitters to develop this audio communication, a stark contrast from earlier spark-gap technology that could only transmit Morse code.  Realizing its new capabilities, Westinghouse added radio receivers to its home appliance line and planned to produce regular radio programming.  Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer operating his own weekly amateur ‚Äúham‚Äù radio broadcast, was enlisted to help launch the station. In October 1920, Westinghouse obtained a commercial broadcasting authorization from the Department of Commerce‚Äôs Bureau of Navigation.  On November 2, 1920, KDKA transmitted its first scheduled broadcast, airing the continuous live returns of the presidential election between Warren G. Harding and James Cox.  The station went on to provide regular programming thereafter.  It was first to broadcast professional baseball by announcing a game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies on August 5, 1921, and on October 8, 1921, KDKA aired the first live football game between West Virginia University and the University of Pittsburgh. Within four years of the initial broadcast, there were 600 commercial radio stations in the United States. By 1954, there were more radio receivers in the world than printed daily newspapers.  The popularity of radio ushered in a shared national culture.  Syndicated programs like the Grand Ole Opry and American Top 40 hosted by Casey Kasem, mentioned above, connected listeners across the country.  During times of hardship and hope, Americans tuned into their local radio stations to receive the latest news.  On March 12, 1933, President Roosevelt used the broadcast radio to speak directly to the nation in the first of his famous ‚Äúfireside chats‚Äù to help the country manage the Great Depression.  And, yes, I understand he was actually sitting in a room at the White House next to a fireplace during the broadcast!  He went on to hold about 30 of these ‚Äúchats,‚Äù giving the public unprecedented access to a president‚Äôs policies and decision making.  On December 7, 1941, KTU in Honolulu, Hawaii broadcast several hours of live updates during the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.  Millions of Americans tuned in to hear Harry Truman announce Germany‚Äôs unconditional surrender in World War II, Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech, and Neil Armstrong‚Äôs first words on the moon. Radio remains a vital way to communicate today.  It provides local programming, community messaging, and local business advertising in a way other broadcast media do not.  For example, after a major weather event such as a hurricane or tornado, your home may lose power.  When this happens, you lose access to the television, the Internet, and possibly even your mobile phone service.  But your battery-operated radio receiver still works!  In such circumstances, radio broadcasts have proven, time and time again, to be the most reliable outlet for public safety information.  Importantly, radio remains freely available to anyone with a receiver, unlike many new sources of audio information and entertainment, which require subscriptions or costly equipment.  Radio continues to play a unique role in society due to its ability to reach nearly all of the U.S. population with free news and information no matter where the listener is located.  As such, radio is unparalleled in its ability to provide listeners with news, weather, sports and other information that is specific to their particular community. The Commission continues to work hard to support this historic industry by modernizing its radio regulations.  In 2000, the Low Power FM radio service was created to provide highly local, noncommercial broadcasts.  In the early 2000s, the FCC approved digital operations for AM and FM stations, allowing for significant improvements to the quality of radio signals.  Today, there are an estimated 4,200 digital broadcasts on air.  Earlier this year, the LPFM rules were updated to make sure the service remains viable.  Additionally, since 2013, the Commission, through its AM revitalization initiative, updated the rules for the AM service allowing AM stations to own FM translators, modifying daytime and nighttime community coverage standards, eliminating the ‚Äúratchet rule,‚Äù and relaxing minimum antenna efficiency standards.  Most recently, last month the Commission took a further step in the digital radio transition and authorized AM stations to voluntarily end analog broadcasts and adopt all-digital broadcasting.  This will allow AM stations to offer listeners higher quality audio, more reliable digital service and new ancillary data services. Radio was one of the first electronic technologies to permeate the lives of the American people.  It has shaped not only our memories, but how most of us experienced the events of the past century.  It is a highly adaptable technology and perhaps the most accessible medium of our time.  We look forward to the stories it will continue to tell, and the pictures it will continue to paint over the next 100 years!

3	The FCC's Authority to Interpret Section 230 of the Communications Act	Thomas M. Johnson Jr.	2020-10-21 10:30:00	1603301400.0	Last week, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced his intent to move forward with a rulemaking to interpret Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934. Under certain circumstances, Section 230 provides websites, including social media companies, that host or moderate content generated by others with immunity from liability. In announcing his decision, Chairman Pai noted that ‚Äú[m]embers of all three branches of government have expressed serious concern about the prevailing interpretation‚Äù of Section 230, and observed that an overly broad interpretation could ‚Äúshield[] social media companies from consumer protection laws in a way that has no basis in the text‚Äù of the statute.       The Chairman‚Äôs decision was consistent with my advice that the FCC has the legal authority to interpret Section 230. Due to the unique interest generated by this proceeding, Chairman Pai has now asked me to make my analysis public, in furtherance of his longstanding commitment to transparency in the rulemaking process. The policy issues raised by the debate over Section 230 may be complex, but the FCC‚Äôs legal authority is straightforward. Simply put, the FCC has the authority to interpret all provisions of the Communications Act, including amendments such as Section 230. As I explain below, this authority flows from the plain meaning of Section 201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, which confers on the FCC the power to issue rules necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. By expressly directing that Section 230 be placed into the Communications Act, Congress made clear that the FCC‚Äôs rulemaking authority extended to the provisions of that section. Two seminal U.S. Supreme Court cases authored by the late Justice Antonin Scalia‚ÄîAT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S. 366 (1999) and City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290 (2013)‚Äîconfirm this conclusion. Based on this authority, the Commission can feel confident proceeding with a rulemaking to clarify the scope of the Section 230 immunity shield. Statutory Background To understand why the Commission has authority to interpret Section 230, it helps to understand how that section became part of the Communications Act. In 1934, Congress adopted the Communications Act in its original form, establishing the FCC as an independent federal agency charged with regulating interstate and international communications. Four years later, Congress added Section 201(b), which delegated to the Commission the power to ‚Äúprescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this Act.‚Äù  Since then, the most consequential set of amendments to the Communications Act arrived in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which updated the Act for the then-nascent Internet age. Section 1(b) of that Act made clear that, except where otherwise expressly provided, each of the 1996 Act‚Äôs provisions were to be inserted into the Communications Act of 1934. Title V of the 1996 Act was named the ‚ÄúCommunications Decency Act of 1996.‚Äù Among other provisions, this Title included Section 509, named ‚ÄúOnline family empowerment.‚Äù Consistent with Section 1(b), Congress instructed in Section 509 that ‚ÄúTitle II of the Communications Act of 1934 . . . is amended by adding at the end the following new section: Section 230.‚Äù Thus, Section 230 was born and became part of the Communications Act of 1934. Section 230 provides, among other things, that ‚Äú[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.‚Äù It further provides that ‚Äú[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of . . . any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.‚Äù The term ‚Äúinteractive computer service‚Äù is defined ‚Äúas any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions.‚Äù That broad definition is commonly understood to include websites that host or moderate content generated by others, such as social media companies. The FCC‚Äôs Interpretive Authority The Supreme Court has twice considered whether the FCC‚Äôs general rulemaking authority under Section 201(b), adopted in 1938, extends to the 1996 amendments to the Act. Both times, the Court held that it does. Writing for the Court in Iowa Utilities Board, and employing his trademark textualist method, Justice Scalia wrote that this provision ‚Äúmeans what it says: The FCC has rulemaking authority to carry out the ‚Äòprovisions of [the 1934] Act.‚Äô‚Äù The Court explained that ‚Äúthe clear fact that the 1996 Act was adopted, not as a freestanding enactment, but as an amendment to, and hence part of, [the 1934] Act‚Äù shows that Congress intended the Commission to have rulemaking authority over all its provisions. Likewise, in the later City of Arlington case, the Court confirmed that the Commission‚Äôs rulemaking authority ‚Äú[o]f course . . . extends to the subsequently added portions of the Act.‚Äù From these authorities, a simple conclusion follows: Because Section 230 is among the ‚Äúsubsequently added portions of the Act,‚Äù it is subject to the FCC‚Äôs Section 201(b) rulemaking authority. This rulemaking authority plainly encompasses the power to interpret ambiguous language throughout the Communications Act. And courts have repeatedly upheld the Commission‚Äôs authority to do so. City of Arlington, for example, upheld the Commission‚Äôs use of its authority under Section 201(b) to interpret a provision that preserved state and local authority over the placement of things like cell towers unless those localities failed to act within a ‚Äúreasonable period of time.‚Äù The Supreme Court rejected an argument that the agency should receive no deference for its interpretation because the provision was ‚Äújurisdictional‚Äù and thus contemplated no regulatory action by the Commission. The Commission deserved deference, the Court explained, because ‚ÄúCongress has unambiguously vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communications Act through rulemaking and adjudication, and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.‚Äù  Likewise, in City of Portland v. FCC, 969 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. 2020), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit earlier this year largely affirmed two FCC orders clarifying the scope of a preemption provision in the Communications Act that provides that states and localities may not take actions that ‚Äúhave the effect of prohibiting‚Äù telecommunications service. Citing City of Arlington, the court said that ‚Äú[w]here terms of the Telecommunications Act are ambiguous, we defer to the FCC‚Äôs reasonable interpretations.‚Äù Concerning the Commission‚Äôs interpretive authority, there is no meaningful distinction between the jurisdictional provision in City of Arlington, the preemption provision in City of Portland, and the immunity shield in Section 230 of the Act. All three provisions appear in the Communications Act, as amended. And like the jurisdictional and preemption provisions, Section 230 contains ambiguous terms: What constitutes an action ‚Äúvoluntarily taken in good faith‚Äù to restrict access to material? What constitutes material that can be excluded as ‚Äúotherwise objectionable‚Äù? As in City of Arlington and City of Portland, the Commission has the authority to clarify these ambiguities in Section 230. As the Supreme Court observed in Iowa Utilities Board, this conclusion is nothing more than application of the general principle, derived from the Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark decision in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), that ‚ÄúCongress is well aware that the ambiguities it chooses to produce in a statute will be resolved by the implementing agency.‚Äù Response to Common Objections In response to the U.S. Department of Commerce‚Äôs petition asking the Commission to pursue a rulemaking on Section 230, some commenters supported the FCC‚Äôs authority to clarify the statute. Others, reading Section 201(b)‚Äîas well as Iowa Utilities Board and City of Arlington‚Äînarrowly, claimed that the FCC lacked such authority. I found the arguments of this latter group of commenters unpersuasive. Some commenters claim that Congress did not intend for the Commission to administer Section 230, and therefore, the Commission has no authority to interpret it. Sometimes called ‚ÄúChevron Step Zero,‚Äù this inquiry focuses on whether agencies deserve deference at all where there is no clear evidence that Congress intended the agency, rather than courts, to interpret an ambiguous statute. But the Supreme Court‚Äôs conclusion that Congress adopted the entire 1996 Act against the backdrop of the FCC‚Äôs Section 201 rulemaking power while leaving that power in place appears to foreclose this argument. As the Supreme Court put it in City of Arlington, ‚Äúthe whole [Act] includes all of its parts,‚Äù and therefore, the Court does not engage in a freewheeling judicial inquiry whereby ‚Äúevery agency rule must be subjected to a de novo judicial determination of whether the particular issue was committed to agency discretion.‚Äù     There is no reason why Section 230 of the Act alone should escape Section 201(b)‚Äôs general grant of rulemaking authority. Congress specifically instructed‚Äîin Section 509 of the Communications Decency Act, which in turn was in Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996‚Äîthat a new Section 230 be added to the Communications Act. While Section 230 itself deals primarily with an immunity shield, that fact alone does not exempt it from Commission rulemaking. City of Arlington and City of Portland make clear that the FCC can clarify even those ambiguous statutory provisions within the Act that are arguably directed toward courts‚Äîsuch as preemption or jurisdictional provisions. Similarly, Iowa Utilities Board upheld the Commission‚Äôs authority under Section 201(b) to interpret ambiguous provisions in the Act that provided standards for state utility commissions to resolve pricing and interconnection disputes. Nothing in the Act, the Court explained, ‚Äúlogically preclude[s] the Commission‚Äôs issuance of rules to guide the state-commission judgments.‚Äù The same logic applies here: Section 201(b) allows the Commission to interpret Section 230 to guide the judgments of courts. Others attempt to read limitations into the text of Section 201(b) that could exclude Section 230. They note that most of Section 201(b) deals with rules that apply to common carriers and argue that Congress did not intend to treat social media companies and other covered websites as common carriers. But the general grant of rulemaking authority at the end of Section 201(b) contains no reference to common carriers; it simply empowers the Commission to make rules that are ‚Äúnecessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this Act,‚Äù without qualification. For this reason, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 529 F.3d 763 (6th Cir. 2008), held that Section 201(b) gave the Commission authority to interpret ambiguous provisions in the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Notably, that Act by its terms applies to cable operators, not common carriers. The Court reasoned, relying on Iowa Utilities Board, that it was sufficient that the 1992 law amended the Communications Act and incorporated the relevant provisions therein. The same reasoning applies to Section 230.   Other commenters reach beyond statutory text to argue that Section 230‚Äôs legislative history and purposes demonstrate that the Commission lacks authority to interpret it. As an initial matter, neither legislative history nor abstract purposes can trump the plain text of a statute, and as the Supreme Court has twice held, Section 201(b) ‚Äúmeans what it says‚Äù‚Äîthe FCC has the authority to interpret each and every provision of the Communications Act, as amended. In any event, critics of an FCC rulemaking overread the legislative history and statements of purpose on which they rely and fundamentally misunderstand the narrow authority involved in clarifying the scope of the Section 230 immunity shield. For example, commenters note that language in Section 230(b) expresses Congress‚Äôs intent to ‚Äúpreserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.‚Äù They further point out that Section 230 co-framer and then-Congressman Chris Cox remarked in floor debates prior to passage that ‚Äúwe do not wish to have a Federal Computer Commission with an army of bureaucrats regulating the Internet.‚Äù And they observe that the FCC cited these authorities in the Restoring Internet Freedom Order as support for its decision to repeal the prior Administration‚Äôs onerous ‚Äúnet neutrality‚Äù rules in favor of light-touch regulation of Internet service providers. But none of these observations bear on the central question here: whether the Commission has authority to interpret ambiguous terms in Section 230(c), which contains the immunity shield. Engaging in such interpretation would not involve creating ‚Äúnet neutrality‚Äù rules for social media companies, much less (as some critics have claimed) a ‚ÄúFairness Doctrine‚Äù for the Internet. Rather, it would involve clarifying a legal standard that already exists: the statutory immunity shield in Section 230. Even if the FCC were to interpret that shield more narrowly than some courts previously have, that would not result in additional FCC regulation. It would simply allow private parties to bring lawsuits, as appropriate, under other sources of federal and state law‚Äîthe same generally-applicable causes of action that apply to newspapers, broadcasters, and other publishers and speakers not covered by Section 230. Nor does it matter that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Comcast v. FCC, 600 F.3d 642 (D.C. Cir. 2010), and the FCC itself in the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, agreed that Section 230(b) was merely a statement of policy and not an affirmative source of authority. The Commission need not rely on Section 230(b) as the source of its authority in this contemplated rulemaking. Instead, the Commission can comfortably use Section 201(b) to resolve ambiguities in the text of Section 230(c)‚Äîwhich City of Arlington and Iowa Utilities Board plainly permit. At the end of the day, the scope of the Section 230 immunity shield must be interpreted by someone. And as the Supreme Court observed in both Iowa Utilities Board and City of Arlington, the only question is whether the FCC or a federal court will do the interpreting. Under current law, the answer is clear: The FCC receives deference for reasonable interpretations of all ambiguous terms in the Communications Act. The fact that courts have been interpreting Section 230 for years does not prevent the Commission from construing its ambiguous terms. As the Supreme Court held in National Cable & Telecomms. Ass‚Äôn v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967 (2005), the FCC may act as the ‚Äúauthoritative interpreter‚Äù of ambiguous provisions in statutes like the Communications Act that it administers, and nothing ‚Äúpreclude[s] agencies from revising unwise judicial constructions of ambiguous statutes.‚Äù Section 230 allows the FCC to determine whether courts have appropriately interpreted its proper scope. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, recently expressed the view that courts have ‚Äúrelied on policy and purpose arguments to grant sweeping protection to Internet platforms‚Äù under Section 230 that ‚Äúdeparted from the most natural reading of the text.‚Äù Leaving such constructions unchallenged could, in Justice Thomas‚Äôs words, ‚Äúhave serious consequences,‚Äù like exempting Internet companies from a broad array of civil claims, even if that is not ‚Äúwhat the law demands.‚Äù Under Brand X, the FCC may review these judicial interpretations to determine whether they reflect the best reading of the statute. Indeed, an agency‚Äôs role as ‚Äúauthoritative interpreter‚Äù may be particularly useful where, as here, courts have reached divergent interpretations of key provisions of an important statute, thus creating substantial uncertainty and disharmony in the law. * * * Ultimately, the five Commissioners of the FCC must decide whether this legal framework should be adopted in any future rulemaking. But in my own judgment, the FCC‚Äôs legal authority to interpret Section 230 is straightforward: Congress gave the Commission power to interpret all provisions of the Communications Act of 1934‚Äîincluding amendments‚Äîand Section 230 is an amendment to the Communications Act. The Commission therefore may proceed with a rulemaking to clarify the scope of the Section 230(c) immunity shield.

4	Halloween Treats	Ajit Pai	2020-10-05 14:25:00	1601933100.0	October has arrived, which means there‚Äôs a chill in the air, baseball playoffs on TV, and pumpkin spice in places where it doesn‚Äôt belong. Of course, there is no greater October tradition than Halloween. While nobody is quite sure what trick-or-treating will look like in a time of social distancing, I can say for sure that the agenda for the Commission‚Äôs October meeting will be filled with treats for consumers and innovators. Unfortunately, we‚Äôll have to start off that meeting by discussing a trick. In 2017, numerous Washington politicians, far-left special-interest groups, Hollywood stars, and Silicon Valley tech giants, as well as many in the media tried to scare the American people about what would happen once the FCC adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. In that order, we overturned the previous Administration‚Äôs decision to heavily regulate the Internet like a slow-moving utility under rules developed in the 1930s and restored the longstanding, bipartisan, market-based approach. The American people were told that they would get the Internet one word at a time. They were told that they would have to pay $5 per tweet. They were told that it would be the end of the Internet as we know it. It was frightening stuff to be sure, but it was utter nonsense. Well, in December 2017, we ignored the falsehoods (and the ruckus they created, which included death threats, a bomb threat that forced us to recess our Commission meeting, and targeted harassment) and did the right thing. We replaced the prior Administration‚Äôs heavy-handed regulations with a consistent, light-touch regulatory approach that protects the free and open Internet, encourages infrastructure investment, and requires strong transparency from broadband providers for consumers and innovators alike. And what‚Äôs been the result? The Internet has remained free and open. And it‚Äôs stronger than ever. Millions more Americans have access to the Internet today than in 2017. In 2018 and then again in 2019, the United States set records for annual fiber deployment, and we‚Äôve seen network investment hit levels that our nation hadn‚Äôt seen for over a decade. In fact, since we adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, average download speeds for fixed broadband in the United States have doubled, increasing by over 99% (so much for getting the Internet one word at a time). And in 2018 and 2019, we added over 72,000 wireless cell sites in the United States, after adding fewer than 20,000 in the prior four years. Moreover, during the pandemic, our networks have held up extremely well. Not only have they handled the surge in Internet traffic, but average speeds have actually gone up over the past six months. We haven‚Äôt had to follow the path of some other countries, which embraced utility-style Internet regulation and, after years of subpar infrastructure investment, had to ask streaming services like Netflix and YouTube to proactively throttle consumers‚Äô video streams from HD to SD. The FCC scored a major victory when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the vast majority of our decision in the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. However, the court asked us to consider in more detail three discrete issues‚Äînamely, (1) the Order‚Äôs effect on public safety; (2) its effect on our ability to regulate pole attachments; and (3) its effect on the Lifeline program‚Äôs ability to support broadband. Months ago, we put out a Public Notice seeking input on these three issues. Having reviewed the input received, the law, and the facts, I am confident that the regulatory framework we set forth in the Restoring Internet Freedom Order appropriately and adequately addresses each issue. Accordingly, I have circulated an Order for consideration at our October meeting addressing the points raised by the D.C. Circuit. It affirms that the FCC stands by the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, consistent with the practical reality consumers have experienced since December 2017 of an Internet economy that is better, stronger, and freer than ever. One treat everyone is hoping for‚Äîthe Reese‚Äôs Peanut Butter Cup of telecom, if you will‚Äîis 5G. We anticipate that the deployment of 5G-capable networks will deliver better services for consumers, drive job creation, and strengthen the nation‚Äôs economy and our quality of life. But we need to make sure that 5G narrows rather than widens the digital divide‚Äîand that means making sure that rural Americans also benefit from the next generation of wireless innovation Today, I circulated rules to establish a 5G Fund for Rural America. The new program would use multi-round reverse auctions to distribute up to $9 billion, in two phases, to bring voice and 5G broadband service to rural areas of our country that would be unlikely to see the deployment of 5G-capable networks without subsidies. Building upon lessons learned from the Mobility Fund, and overwhelming support in the factual record we‚Äôve developed, we would adopt our proposal to determine which areas will be eligible for 5G Fund support based on improved mobile broadband coverage data that will be gathered through the Commission‚Äôs new Digital Opportunity Data Collection. This approach won‚Äôt be the fastest possible path to the Phase I auction, but it will allow us to identify with greater precision those areas of the country where support is most needed and will be spent most efficiently. This is just one of two major items on our October agenda to expand wireless broadband connectivity in rural America. The second involves slivers of spectrum in the TV broadcast bands and 600 MHz frequencies that are not being used for other authorized services. Unlicensed devices can operate in these so-called ‚Äúwhite spaces.‚Äù These airwaves cover a lot of ground (they have excellent ‚Äúpropagation characteristics,‚Äù in the parlance), which makes them particularly attractive for delivering wireless broadband services in rural areas and areas where fewer broadcast television stations operate. In three weeks, the Commission will vote on a Report and Order that would make targeted changes to our white space device rules by expanding these devices‚Äô ability to provide broadband coverage in rural and unserved areas while still protecting television broadcasters in the band. The Order would also modify our rules to facilitate the development of new and innovative narrowband Internet of Things devices in TV white spaces. We expect that these changes will spur continued growth of the white space ecosystem and help to close the digital divide. The deployment of wireless infrastructure continues to be a priority for American consumers who are increasingly relying on mobile devices, and the Commission accordingly continues to explore ways to reduce regulatory barriers to such deployment. We‚Äôll vote on our latest proposal this month. Here‚Äôs the context: When it comes to building out 5G networks, using existing infrastructure is often a more efficient alternative to the construction of new infrastructure. 5G networks will require deployment of a significant number of additional antennas, many of which could be placed on existing infrastructure. But these existing towers may need additional equipment on the ground to support the operation of these antennas. To facilitate the collocation of antennas and associated ground equipment, the Commission will vote on a proposal to further streamline the state and local government review process for limited modifications to existing wireless infrastructure. Congress limited state and local jurisdictions‚Äô authority to deny these modifications in 2012, under section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act. Under the order we will vote on this month, excavation and deployment up to 30 feet in any direction outside of the existing site would not ‚Äúsubstantially change‚Äù the physical dimensions of the facility and therefore would not disqualify the collocation from streamlined state and local review. I would like to thank Commissioner Carr for his leadership on this Order in particular and the Commission‚Äôs wireless infrastructure efforts generally. Next on our October agenda will be a handful of items to make sure the Commission‚Äôs rules are keeping pace with changes in the marketplace. As part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Congress imposed requirements that local telephone companies (known as incumbent local exchange carriers) make portions of their networks available to competitors on an unbundled basis at regulated rates, and that they make certain services available for resale to competitors at regulated rates. But the communications landscape has transformed dramatically over the last 23 years. The voice and broadband marketplaces are filled with competition from a multitude of providers using a variety of technologies and offering capabilities and services unforeseen in 1996. The Commission has repeatedly adjusted the incumbent LEC-specific obligations in the 1996 Act, including unbundling and resale requirements, to account for changed circumstances. Given the dramatic change in the market in recent years and continued vigorous debate on this topic, I encouraged industry to negotiate and propose solutions for the path forward in this area. INCOMPAS and USTelecom led negotiations and ultimately submitted two compromise proposals, helping us close out one of the most contentious issues underlying the 1996 Act‚Äîthe appropriate scope of the Commission‚Äôs unbundling rules. I want to thank them for coming to the table in good faith and doing the painstaking work that consensus-building requires. Based on their work, I‚Äôve circulated a Report and Order that would continue to modernize these requirements and would end unbundling and resale requirements where they stifle the transition to IP networks and broadband deployment. At the same time, it would preserve unbundling requirements where they are still necessary to realize the 1996 Act‚Äôs goal of robust intermodal competition benefiting all Americans. The revitalization of the AM radio service has long been a passion of mine, which is why I am pleased that this month we will also consider an item that will continue our efforts to help AM radio operators keep pace with changes in the market. AM radio stations are currently authorized to operate with either analog signals or hybrid signals, which combine analog and digital signals. However, analog signals are increasingly subject to interference from electronic devices, and due to a number of technical constraints of the AM band and limitations of the HD Radio hybrid mode, fewer than 250 AM stations have implemented hybrid operations. This October, the Commission will vote on a Report and Order that would give AM broadcasters the option to convert to all-digital operations, which offer listeners a higher quality audio experience over a greater area. Since all-digital broadcasting would be on a voluntary basis, AM operators would decide for themselves if the transition is right for them and their listeners. I will note one interesting data point: WWFD in Frederick, Maryland has transitioned to digital AM through special temporary authority, and has gone from having no ratings in the market to a being a Nielsen-ranked station. This hints at digital AM‚Äôs potential to bring AM stations back from the brink of extinction to become competitive players in the market. On October 27, we‚Äôll also be updating our rules to make sure more television programming is accessible to Americans with disabilities. Audio description makes television programming accessible to the blind or visually impaired by inserting a narrated audio description of a program‚Äôs key visual elements at breaks in the dialogue. The Commission‚Äôs rules currently require certain commercial television broadcast stations in only the top 60 television markets to provide video-described programming. In a few weeks, we‚Äôll vote on new rules to expand the Commission‚Äôs video description regulations by phasing them in for an additional 10 markets each year for the next four years. Additionally, we‚Äôll be revising our rules to adopt the term ‚Äúaudio description‚Äù instead of ‚Äúvideo description,‚Äù a recommendation made by disability rights advocates, including the Commission‚Äôs Disability Advisory Committee. This will ensure that the Commission uses the terminology currently used throughout the federal government and the industry, providing consistency for everyone. Rounding out our monthly meeting will be an Enforcement Bureau item, the details of which cannot be disclosed at this time. Here‚Äôs wishing everyone a happy October. Stay safe, and happy Halloween in advance!

5	Strategic Improvements to Media Regulations	Michael O'Rielly	2020-09-25 16:25:00	1601076300.0	To quote the proverbial infomercial announcer, ‚ÄúBut wait, there‚Äôs more!‚Äù Nearly every month under the current Commission, we have considered items to improve the media regulation landscape for our nation‚Äôs treasured broadcasters. Considered on their own, many of these actions may seem limited in their significance. Taken together, however, these modernization efforts have served to alleviate real burdens imposed on broadcasters, in turn allowing them to better serve their viewers or listeners and advance the goal of localism in communities around the country. While I am hopeful that we will bring all relevant open proceedings to conclusion by year‚Äôs end, this process has also helped highlight just how backward and outdated certain aspects of our media regulation regime really are, and therefore, how much work remains to be done.  To facilitate this process, I would humbly submit a few more ideas, in addition to those I have previously proposed, that the Commission could quickly implement to improve the plight of America‚Äôs struggling broadcasters and support local journalism. As many broadcasters seek to rebound from the double-whammy of COVID-19 and asymmetric competition from unregulated Internet-based providers, these reforms are more critical than ever. To be clear, many of these proposals could exist within the confines of our current regulatory regime, which is governed by misguided court mandates and is at odds with the contemporary media marketplace.  I haven‚Äôt abandoned my beliefs or policy preferences in favor of dramatically altering our media rules, especially those governing common ownership, but until such an overhaul is sanctioned by the Commission, the Supreme Court, or Congress, we must focus on improving the current broken system incrementally. Ending Freeze on License Modifications Over a decade ago, the Commission placed a freeze on applications to make technical upgrades or modifications to stations to facilitate the Broadcast Incentive Auction and subsequent repack. For good reason, this freeze was established to avoid overwhelming the staff working on the Incentive Auction transition and to ensure the process did not become overly difficult or complex. In the long run, however, it‚Äôs kept stations that were not repacked from investing in and upgrading their physical infrastructure.  For example, certain equipment installed more than 10 years ago during the digital transition may be failing, but due to the freeze, stations are unable to modify or improve technical facilities. These stations are faced with the unpalatable choice between using scarce financial resources to make stop-gap repairs or purchasing replacement equipment that will become a stranded investment once the Commission lifts the freeze and allows them to improve or modify their stations to better serve their communities. Now that the repack has essentially concluded, stations should be permitted to start filing applications for needed upgrades.  If the processing window for applications is opened, stations could start procuring equipment and lining up technicians to carry out the work immediately. Otherwise, we jeopardize the ability of some stations to serve their communities effectively and bounce back from the challenges of 2020.  With each passing month, it becomes increasingly critical to restart this process. Updating Failing Station Criteria It is past time to update the criteria for a failing broadcast station, or at minimum, adjust the presumption in favor of a failing station waiver.  By way of background, the Commission‚Äôs outdated restrictions prevent common ownership of certain broadcast stations within the same market without a waiver.  One justification for obtaining such a waiver is that a station is ‚Äúfailing‚Äù ‚Äî i.e., the station has been struggling for ‚Äúan extended period of time both in terms of its audience share and financial performance.‚Äù To justify such a waiver, criteria must be met: (1) one of the merging stations has had a low all-day audience share (i.e. 4 percent or lower); (2) the station has had negative cash flow for the previous three years; (3) the merger will produce tangible and verifiable public interest benefits; and (4) the in-market buyer is the only reasonably available candidate willing and able to acquire and operate the station, and selling the station to an out-of-market buyer would result in an artificially depressed price. By meeting each of the prongs, an application is presumed to be in the public interest.  Unfortunately, the failing station test is incredibly outdated. Specifically, the first two prongs haven‚Äôt been updated since their creation and do not reflect the true state of a station in trouble. Consider that the pandemic has helped to exacerbate a paradox of local broadcasting: even though local news ratings have significantly increased, and local journalism has been extremely important to communities all across the country during this time, ad revenue has dramatically fallen off. Therefore, even though some stations appear to be doing well from a viewership perspective, they are hemorrhaging cash trying to keep their journalists safe and well-equipped to cover current events, both in the field and in the studios.  Further, having a negative cash flow for three years is far too long and too broad a measurement to be used as a relief trigger.  Industry experts suggest a better time frame may be 18 months and that negative cash flow should be replaced with a combination of operating losses, debt obligations, and/or inability to access capital. The bigger problem with the failing station structure is that it functions as the only objective, practical means to get a waiver.  In other words, while the Commission could waive its ownership rules for other reasons, passing the bright-line test is the only clear path to relief. Yet, there are other situations worthy of similar treatment.  Consider those cases in which the merger of two or more stations in a market would dramatically improve desired local programming.  While this could arguably satisfy prong 3, it would not necessarily be sufficient to fulfill the rest of the failing station test.  Instead, we should establish separate criteria, perhaps even a new process that is separate from the failing station test, for presuming certain mergers that improve local and/or live programming are in the public interest. There should be a clear path for transactions that would improve such programming, as well as those that would preserve station employment levels and result in more resources being invested in the purchased station.  As with other presumptions built into our regulations, this change would not equate to automatic approval of applications.  But, what it would do is open the door to allow for creative solutions in today‚Äôs market to keep stations on the air and protect local journalists‚Äô jobs. Take, for example, the combination of stations within the Sioux Falls television market, which I‚Äôve written about elsewhere, and which was part of a recent study that quantified the benefits of such arrangements. Sioux Falls is a story of relative success, where local news has blossomed despite the pandemic. Unfortunately, we have also seen how existing approaches have decimated local newsrooms in places such as Casper, Wyoming. The latter is a painful example of how myopic limitations can significantly harm local journalism, and in turn create huge losses for communities, both in terms of jobs and local news. If a failing station waiver helps to avoid such outcomes, then perhaps now is a good time to bring the presumption into line with today‚Äôs needs.  If, for some reason even these reasonable, modest changes are deemed too much ‚Äî which would be disappointing and hard to fathom ‚Äî the Commission absolutely can and must clarify that the failing station presumption is just that, a presumption, and that nothing prevents applicants from applying for a waiver, and ultimately receiving approval, by way of other approaches or under other circumstances. In other words, the existence of one type of presumption does not preclude consideration and approval of transactions that would be justified for separate reasons. Low Power Station Relocations The Commission could further limit unnecessary regulatory burdens by allowing waivers of our LPTV processing rules for in-market station moves that would otherwise be approved. Current rules bar LPTV moves that are more than 30 miles, even if they are moving within their existing market. This has sometimes led to the absurd result of stations having to file applications repeatedly when moving within their existing DMA, ‚Äúinching‚Äù along 30 miles at a time. I know of at least one LPTV station that is seeking to move within an Alaska DMA, and one can only imagine the difficulties that this caterpillar-like process would pose in that geography and over that distance. I am not suggesting that waivers be automatically granted, but simply that waivers of the 30-mile limit can and should be granted, and that it shouldn‚Äôt be necessary to file multiple applications for moves entirely within the DMA. This common-sense change would go a long way in helping to avoid the current, overly-burdensome process facing some stations. VHF to UHF & Communities of License Changes Two further ideas worthy of action would be updating the rules related to VHF stations seeking to upgrade to UHF channels and easing the process for television stations to change their community of license in certain cases. For some reason, nothing seems to strike fear into some hearts as the prospect of stations changing channels or changing communities. And, that‚Äôs despite the fact that our staff did extremely well managing the Incentive Auction repack ‚Äì and deserves sincere praise. Since these fears are often unfounded, it‚Äôs time to also consider updating the regulations for these types of applications.  In the case of moving VHF channels to the UHF band, it‚Äôs important to note that existing technical rules were crafted in the 1960s, back when color television sets were cutting edge and sometimes even the size of small cars.  While there are some VHF stations that are within the top two in their markets among MVPD viewers, these stations can barely maintain a top-4 position with over-the-air viewers due to reception problems caused by environmental noise and horrendous VHF propagation characteristics.  Meanwhile, with the increased pace of cord-cutting, it is more important than ever that viewers ‚Äì especially low-income viewers that may disproportionately receive their news and information from an over-the-air-signal ‚Äì have access to robust, quality signals. These stations could likely make a strong case for a channel change, but they are hamstrung due to problematic analog-era precedent remaining on the books, making for an unnecessarily difficult process.  Similarly, for some stations seeking to make a community of license change that would only shift the station contour very slightly, 1970s-era precedent prevents service improvements that would substantially benefit local viewers.  While these changes should only be permitted to the extent that they don‚Äôt frustrate other Commission priorities, maintaining outdated, artificial limitations that impede the mere consideration of such applications is the wrong approach, and worthy of change. *** Harmonizing our broadcast regulations with market realities is a Commission obligation. While holistic change is unlikely in the near-term, the changes I‚Äôm proposing today could be pursued within the bounds of our current rules while significantly improving the overall regulatory regime. 	{0: {'username': 'Rokhad', 'date_epoch': 1632828780.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-09-28 04:33:00', 'response_content': 'GTA 6 Everything that we know so far about Grand Theft Auto VI: From characters to fascinating rumors...'}, 1: {'username': 'Rokhad', 'date_epoch': 1631892120.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-09-17 08:22:00', 'response_content': 'Production of waist bags best waist bags'}, 2: {'username': 'Rokhad', 'date_epoch': 1631681520.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-09-14 21:52:00', 'response_content': 'League of Legends is perhaps one of the most successful and popular video game genres and has gained countless fans worldwide'}, 3: {'username': 'Rokhad', 'date_epoch': 1631076240.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-09-07 21:44:00', 'response_content': 'PUBG game an outdated but still enjoying battle royal'}, 4: {'username': 'Rokhad', 'date_epoch': 1630901280.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-09-05 21:08:00', 'response_content': 'Minecraft game Craft your dreams'}, 5: {'username': 'Rokhad', 'date_epoch': 1629483360.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-08-20 11:16:00', 'response_content': 'list of commercial electrical services EAMA caters to commercial properties of any and all types'}, 6: {'username': 'Rokhad', 'date_epoch': 1629479520.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-08-20 10:12:00', 'response_content': 'When do players rotate?

6	Wireless Emergency Alerts: A Preparedness Tool	Lisa M. Fowlkes	2020-09-10 10:50:00	1599760200.0	It‚Äôs National Preparedness Month, when Americans are urged to plan for disasters. So here‚Äôs a recap of the latest developments in Wireless Emergency Alerts, including the enhancements that are available and steps that emergency managers and the public can take to make the most of this critical tool. Enhanced Geo-targeting One significant development is that Wireless Emergency Alerts are now more geographically targeted than ever before. Since last December, in response to FCC rules changes, participating wireless providers are required to deliver alerts to the entire area targeted by emergency management officials with no more than a one-tenth of a mile overshoot. (If that‚Äôs not technically feasible, wireless providers must continue to deliver alerts to their best approximation of the target area, our standard since 2017.) This is a big improvement from when the Wireless Emergency Alert program launched in 2012 and alerts were sent on a county-wide basis. All new ‚ÄúWEA-capable‚Äù mobile devices offered for sale after last December must support this enhanced geo-targeting. As a result, we expect the improvement to become more widely available over time, as consumers purchase new smartphones. Our rules also require wireless providers to support enhanced geo-targeting on WEA-capable mobile devices that were released before last December and are capable of being upgraded to support this feature. The FCC is committed to monitoring implementation progress and keeping the public safety community and other stakeholders informed. To that end, Chairman Pai today requested that CTIA update the Commission annually on the wireless industry‚Äôs estimated market penetration rates for mobile devices that support enhanced geo-targeting. The Chairman also wrote to Qualcomm, which makes the chipsets for many mobile devices, requesting confirmation that it plans to support enhanced geo-targeting in all the 5G devices that its chipsets support in the United States. In addition, he wrote to Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), a standards organization, requesting the development of best practices to further improve enhanced geo-targeting. More Informative and Relevant Alert Messages Also beginning last December, emergency management officials can send Wireless Emergency Alerts that contain more information, with the maximum message length increased from 90 to 360 characters. Plus, officials can send alerts in Spanish and use a new class of alerts (‚ÄúPublic Safety Messages‚Äù) to convey recommendations for saving lives or property, such as the location of emergency shelters after a disaster. Many local officials are putting these improvements to use. We recommend that emergency managers review these tips for using the new Wireless Emergency Alert enhancements and tips for issuing multilingual alerts. New Testing In addition, as of December, emergency managers can conduct state and local Wireless Emergency Alert tests that reach only consumers who choose to participate. These tests do not require a waiver from the FCC. Consumers can support emergency preparedness in their community by opting in to receive test alerts. If such a test is conducted in your area, your local officials may publicize how to opt in on your mobile phone. (Some popular mobile devices enable you to opt-in via the Notification setting.) You can check with your wireless provider or device manufacturer for details. Last, but certainly not least, we very strongly urge consumers to keep Wireless Emergency Alerts enabled on their phones, which is the default setting.

7	A Big Fall Kickoff	Ajit Pai	2020-09-08 13:35:00	1599597300.0	For sports fans, this is the week we‚Äôve all been waiting for. Football is finally back! In two days, the Super Bowl LIV champion Kansas City Chiefs will begin their title defense and kick off the NFL season when they host the Houston Texans. (Did I mention my beloved Chiefs are Super Bowl champions?) The return of the NFL also means the return of fantasy football. In this spirit, the FCC‚Äôs September agenda looks like a well-balanced fantasy team. Just as you would assemble a fantasy roster with a quarterback, running backs, receivers, a tight end, a kicker, and a defense, we‚Äôre rolling out a diverse lineup featuring at least one item from each of the Commission‚Äôs seven bureaus. Consistent with the popular strategy of picking running backs in the early rounds, our September agenda leads off with a pair of workhorse spectrum items from our Wireless Telecommunications Bureau. Today, 750 megahertz of spectrum in the 2.9‚Äì3.65 GHz band is allocated for high-powered defense radar systems. But the average measured occupancy (or use) of the 3450‚Äì3550 MHz segment of this band is less than 1% at sites without a significant military presence, according to a study recently completed by the Department of Commerce‚Äôs National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In the MOBILE NOW Act, Congress required that the 3100‚Äì3550 MHz band be studied for the feasibility of commercial use. In 2018, NTIA identified the 3.45‚Äì3.55 GHz band for potential repurposing to spur commercial wireless innovation. And most recently, the White House and the Department of Defense announced last month that this 100 megahertz of contiguous mid-band spectrum should be made available for 5G as quickly as possible. Fortunately, the FCC was already working on ways to maximize use of this spectrum, so we are able to move quickly to do our part to repurpose this mid-band spectrum for commercial 5G. Building on a rulemaking launched in 2019, I have circulated to my fellow commissioners a Report and Order to remove the secondary, non-federal allocations from the 3.3‚Äì3.55 GHz band. This is a critical first step toward making the 3.45‚Äì3.55 GHz band available for innovative commercial operations while accommodating limited remaining operations by federal incumbents ‚Äî one we‚Äôll vote on at our next meeting on September 30. We will also vote on seeking comment on further changes to the band to enable future commercial use, such as reallocating the 3.45‚Äì3.55 GHz band on a co-primary basis for non-federal fixed and mobile (except aeronautical mobile) services, rules for limited future federal incumbent use of the band, and licensing, operating, and technical rules for commercial operations. Along with the upcoming December C-band auction of 280 megahertz of mid-band spectrum for 5G and the recently completed auction of 70 megahertz of licensed spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band, this new proposal would put the Commission on track to have a 530-megahertz swath (from 3.45 to 3.98 GHz) of mid-band spectrum available for 5G. That‚Äôs 5G FAST, to coin a phrase. But we‚Äôre not stopping there in our work to open up access to mid-band airwaves. A second spectrum item on our September agenda aims to make better use of the 4.9 GHz band. Way back in 2002, the FCC designated 50 megahertz of contiguous spectrum in that band for public safety use. Unfortunately, only about 3.5% of potential licensees ‚Äî less than 1 out of 25 ‚Äî have actually taken advantage of this spectrum. A barrier to wireless deployment in this band is the unusual licensing framework. Public safety licensees are permitted to use their spectrum only for public safety purposes, with no exclusivity, and share the band by ad-hoc coordination to avoid interference. In three weeks, the Commission will vote on a Report and Order that would give states the opportunity to lease 4.9 GHz band spectrum to commercial entities, electric utilities, and others. This market-driven path will protect public safety incumbent operations while providing states the flexibility to use the spectrum to boost wireless broadband, improve critical infrastructure monitoring, or facilitate new public safety use cases that meet the unique challenges and geographies of each state. In an accompanying Further Notice, we are also proposing a new state-based licensing regime for public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band. A team‚Äôs overall strength is of course important in fantasy football, and the same goes for government, too. One area where the FCC benefits greatly from the help of our federal partners is our review of applications or petitions by foreign companies trying to enter the U.S. telecommunications market or obtain licenses or authorizations through assignments or transfers of control. The Commission has a lot of expertise in areas like engineering and economics, but we often consult with others when it comes to questions about national security, law enforcement, trade, and foreign affairs. For example, information provided by other agencies about security threats posed by China Mobile played an important role in our decision to reject its application to provide international telecommunications services between the United States and foreign destinations. For over 20 years, we‚Äôve referred certain foreign investment applications to a set of Executive Branch agencies ‚Äî known informally as Team Telecom ‚Äî for their expert review. On April 4, 2020, the President issued an Executive Order formally establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector. The ‚Äúprimary objective‚Äù of the Committee, according to the Executive Order, is ‚Äúto assist the FCC in its public interest review of national security and law enforcement concerns that may be raised by foreign participation in the United States telecommunications services sector.‚Äù The Executive Order established review processes for the Committee for new license applications referred to it by the FCC as well as existing licenses (under certain circumstances). The order also authorized the Committee to make recommendations to the FCC to mitigate risks to national security or law enforcement interests identified through its reviews. Following up on this Executive Order, our International Bureau has prepared a Report and Order to streamline and improve the timeliness and transparency of this inter-agency review process. The new rules will enhance national security while providing greater regulatory certainty for applicants and facilitating foreign investment where appropriate. Many fantasy leagues have that one owner who drives everyone else up the wall with ridiculous trade offers. In the telecom world, that constant nuisance is robocalls. A common weapon used by illegal robocallers is caller ID spoofing, which masks calls with fake, familiar-looking numbers that trick us into thinking a call is trustworthy. To thwart this illegal caller ID spoofing, the FCC has been advancing implementation of the STIR/SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework. STIR/SHAKEN technology, which operates solely on Internet Protocol (IP) networks, allows voice service providers to verify that the caller ID information transmitted with a particular call matches the caller‚Äôs number. This past March, the Commission adopted rules requiring voice service providers to implement this call authentication technology in the IP portions of their phone networks by June 30, 2021, consistent with the newly enacted TRACED Act. Our Wireline Competition Bureau has crafted a new Order, which we will consider at our September meeting, to take the next steps toward STIR/SHAKEN implementation. It would establish rules governing intermediate providers and caller ID authentication in non-IP networks. Specifically, it would require voice service providers to either upgrade their non-IP networks to IP and implement STIR/SHAKEN, or work to develop a non-IP authentication solution. It would also enact pro-consumer provisions of the TRACED Act, like the prohibition of line-item charges for caller ID authentication. Most fantasy players pay a nominal entry fee in hopes that they might take home some prize money at the end of the year. Imagine winning your league, but the Commissioner couldn‚Äôt pay out in full because some of the entry fees had been spent elsewhere. It would be a scandal that would bring down the league! Well, a much worse scandal is playing out across the country ‚Äî and the stakes are very real. Each year, the Commission provides a report to Congress on states‚Äô collection and use of 911 fees that identifies which states have improperly diverted those fees. And each year, a number of states have been identified as diverters, with a few states being repeat offenders. Between 2012 and 2018, states diverted over $1.275 billion in fees collected for 911 services to non-911 purposes. This fee diversion threatens public safety by siphoning away the funds needed to maintain and upgrade 911 systems. But thanks to the leadership of FCC Commissioner Mike O‚ÄôRielly, this problem has been getting the tough scrutiny it deserves. Our Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau has crafted a Notice of Inquiry for our September meeting seeking comment on the effects of 911 fee diversion and exploring additional steps the Commission or others could take to discourage states from diverting 911 fees. Every fantasy league has its own set of rules. Those rules are periodically tweaked and updated to reflect changes in the game, to scrap rules that no longer make sense (like points scored by a D/ST counting against an opposing D/ST), and to improve the experience for league members. We‚Äôre basically doing the same thing at the FCC with our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative. The FCC‚Äôs Media Bureau has led this effort, and its two latest offerings are on our September agenda. The first seeks to make sure consumers are accurately informed rather than confused when there are disputes between video programmers and cable operators. Our rules currently require cable providers to notify consumers 30 days before a channel is dropped from a channel lineup when the channel change is within their control. However, in today‚Äôs video marketplace, retransmission consent and program carriage negotiations are often concluded within days ‚Äî if not hours ‚Äî of the expiration of existing agreements. And in those cases, it is frequently unclear, 30 days prior to a contract‚Äôs expiration, whether a new agreement will be reached, there will be a short-term extension, or programming will be dropped. We don‚Äôt want consumers to be inundated by premature and inaccurate notices. If consumers are bombarded by notices about potential channel lineup changes that never come to fruition, many will ignore notices altogether and thus miss out on notices about actual channel lineup changes. Others might go through the trouble of dropping their existing provider and subscribing to another service, only for these channel changes never to come to pass. Therefore, to make consumer notices more meaningful and accurate, and to make our rules clearer, the Commission will vote on an Order to change the notice deadline from 30 days in advance to ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù in cases in which carriage negotiations fail during the last 30 days of a contract. Our second Media Bureau item is an Order to eliminate our rule requiring that cable operators maintain in their online public inspection file information regarding their attributable interests in video programming services and their carriage of vertically programming on systems in which they have an attributable interest. This recordkeeping rule was originally adopted to help the Commission enforce channel occupancy limits. But those limits have long since been struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, negating any need for this requirement. Moreover, this information can be obtained from sources other than the public inspection files maintained by cable operators, making this reporting requirement unnecessary. Fantasy leagues are often won because a late pick has a big impact (to wit: my sincere gratitude to Arizona Cardinals running back Kenyan Drake, then-Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Breshad Perriman, and Los Angeles Rams tight end Tyler Higbee for the late-season heroics that carried one of my teams to a championship this past season). One of the final items on our September agenda could make a meaningful difference in the daily lives of many Americans with hearing loss. Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service, or IP CTS, allows people who can speak but have difficulty hearing over the telephone to both read captions and use their residual hearing to understand a phone conversation. Use of IP CTS is paid for entirely through the FCC‚Äôs TRS Fund, and it has grown substantially in recent years. Today, this service represents almost 80% of the total minutes compensated out of the TRS Fund ‚Äî at a cost of nearly one billion dollars a year. Our Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau has crafted an Order to bring expenditures for this service more in line with costs, preserving the viability of IP CTS for those people with hearing loss who need it. Specifically, it would reduce the provider compensation rate to $1.42 per minute in 2020‚Äì21 and $1.30 per minute (the current cost-based rate) in 2021‚Äì22. If enacted, this would save the TRS Fund approximately $200 million over the next two years. This Order would also deny Sprint Corporation‚Äôs petition for reconsideration of the interim compensation rates set in 2018 (rates that themselves have already saved taxpayers over $350 million). In addition, in the companion Further Notice for Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission for the first time would propose to establish objective standards for assessing and testing the quality of IP CTS service. Of course, every good fantasy league benefits from a strong Commissioner who enforces the rules and keeps people honest. The Commission‚Äôs Enforcement Bureau handles that task for much of the telecommunications sector. The Bureau will be presenting an item at our September meeting, which I cannot discuss at this time per longstanding practice. I‚Äôm not sure how my fantasy football teams will shape up this year. But I can say for certain that the Commission is stacked with a stellar roster of Bureaus. My thanks to the Consumer and Governmental Affairs, Enforcement, International, Media, Public Safety and Homeland Security, Wireline Competition, and Wireless Telecommunications Bureaus for taking the lead on our September meeting items as well as the Office of Economics and Analytics, Office of Engineering and Technology, and the Office of General Counsel for their assistance in making sure that these items were ready for gameday. This September, each of them has stepped up to make sure we start the fall with victories for U.S. consumers and innovators.

8	The Need For Speed	Ajit Pai	2020-07-15 13:50:00	1594846200.0	If it weren‚Äôt for COVID-19, the Top Gun sequel would be in theaters right now. Nonetheless, you can rest assured that we‚Äôll all be mavericks in three weeks. That‚Äôs because when it comes to our August meeting‚Äôs main attraction, repurposing C-band spectrum for 5G, we feel the need ‚Äî the need for speed. For some time now, the FCC has been aggressively executing the 5G FAST Plan ‚Äî a comprehensive strategy for advancing American leadership in 5G. We want to ensure the United States is the first-mover in 5G innovation so we can attract the innovation, investment, talent, and other benefits that come with global leadership (or as Slider more colloquially said in Top Gun, ‚ÄúRemember boys, no points for second place‚Äù). Along these lines, one of the Commission‚Äôs most significant actions to date was our decision to clear the lower 280 megahertz of the C-band (3.7 GHz to 4.2 GHz) and make this spectrum available for 5G. This was the Commission‚Äôs biggest move ever to reallocate mid-band spectrum, which is particularly appealing for 5G because it combines good geographic coverage with good capacity. When we crafted our rules for repurposing the C-band, we prioritized making this spectrum available for 5G as quickly as possible. That‚Äôs why we rejected calls to do literally nothing until Congress passed a law on the subject (breaking news: it still hasn‚Äôt). That‚Äôs why we included accelerated relocation payments to incumbent satellite operators that will make spectrum available for 5G two to four years earlier than otherwise would have been the case. And that‚Äôs why we proposed an aggressive schedule for holding an auction within the calendar year. Even though the Commission effectively shut down our headquarters less than a month after we adopted the C-band Order, we‚Äôre fully on track and sticking to the schedule. Today, I circulated final draft procedures for a C-band auction to be held on December 8, 2020, and we will vote on them at our August meeting. They spell out the many details of the auction ‚Äî competitive bidding procedures, application requirements, and deadlines governing participation in Auction 107. To spur the deployment of ultra-fast, world-leading 5G networks, we need to make C-band spectrum (among other spectrum bands) available as quickly as possible. If the Commission adopts this plan to launch this auction in December, barely nine months after adopting rules, that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôll be doing. From the sprint of C-band to the marathon of our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative we go. This August, the Commission will be taking two more steps along the road to update our media rules. In 1964, the FCC first adopted rules to restrict the duplication of programming on commonly-owned broadcast radio stations operating in the same geographic area. We‚Äôve revised them several times throughout the decades in response to changing market conditions. The current version of the rule was adopted in 1992. Going on three decades later, the rules are overdue for a revision. So the Commission will be voting on an order to eliminate the radio duplication rule as it pertains to AM stations, but retain its application to FM stations. The record indicates that the realities of the marketplace and technical challenges faced by AM broadcasters suggest the rule should be eliminated with respect to that service. This approach will afford AM broadcast licensees greater flexibility, facilitate all-digital broadcasting by AM stations, and ultimately allow stations to improve service to their communities. The second media modernization item on our August agenda goes all the way back to rules adopted during World War II. Back then, the Commission froze the construction of new broadcast facilities in order to preserve equipment and materials (or materiel, if you‚Äôre so inclined) for the war effort. At the same time, the Commission adopted rules requiring existing broadcast licensees to share their facilities in certain situations. To our knowledge, there has never been a case where all the criteria necessary to invoke the rules were successfully met. And given the significant broadcast infrastructure deployment since then, and the fact most towers are now owned by independent companies that lease tower space to broadcasters, these rules no longer serve any practical purpose. In fact, we didn‚Äôt receive a single comment in the record from any broadcast licensees that would most directly be affected by repealing these antenna siting rules. Hence, an upcoming vote in August to eliminate them. The Commission‚Äôs outdated rules are hardly limited to media. This August, we will also be looking to eliminate some obsolete rules for telecommunications relay services (TRS), which are services that enable those who are deaf, hard of hearing, or deafblind, or have speech disabilities to communicate. The FCC is required by law to make sure that TRS is functionally equivalent to voice services. To that end, we adopted our ‚Äúequal access‚Äù rule, which guarantees that TRS users shall have access to their chosen interexchange carrier, and a ‚Äúbilling options‚Äù requirement, which makes sure TRS customers can be billed for long-distance, operator-assisted, and collect calls like wireline voice users. But with current technology and prevailing offerings in the voice communications market, the ‚Äúequal access‚Äù and ‚Äúbilling options‚Äù rules are now obsolete, and the Commission will vote in August on eliminating them. Among other things, taking this step would relieve TRS providers of the need to maintain antiquated features of circuit-switched networks at a time when they and others within the communications industry have been transitioning to IP-based platforms. We‚Äôll also vote on getting rid of the provision requiring Federal Register publication of requests for comment on state TRS program certification applications, which would improve the efficiency of the Commission‚Äôs TRS certification process and conserve administrative resources (and save a few trees while we‚Äôre at it). Rounding out our August agenda will be an item to reform the rates and charges that inmates pay for telephone service. Access to affordable telecommunications services is critical for all Americans, especially incarcerated members of our society. Inmates who have regular contact with family are more likely to succeed after release and have lower recidivism rates. Yet, unlike virtually every other American, inmates and the people they call generally have no choice in their telephone service provider. Instead, their only option is typically an inmate calling services provider that, once chosen by that correctional facility, operates as a monopolist. Not surprisingly, without effective regulation, rates for inmate calling services can be unjustly and unreasonably high and make it difficult for inmates and their loved ones to stay connected. The D.C. Circuit has twice rejected and remanded the FCC‚Äôs past efforts to address rates and charges for inmate calling services. In this item, we would follow the law and the facts to respond to the court‚Äôs directives and comprehensively reform these rates and charges. First, we will vote on an order that responds to the court‚Äôs remand on ancillary service charges ‚Äî these are separate fees that aren‚Äôt included in the per-minute rates that inmate calling services providers charge for individual calls. While the details are weedy, here‚Äôs the upshot: Because, as a practical matter, these charges generally can‚Äôt be separated between interstate and intrastate calls, inmate calling services providers would generally be subject to the FCC‚Äôs rules when it comes to ancillary service charges ‚Äî including our fee caps and our limits on the types of charges allowed. Second, we will vote to propose lowering our existing caps for interstate calls ‚Äî from $0.21 for debit and prepaid calls and $0.25 for collect calls to $0.14 per minute for debit, prepaid, and collect calls from prisons and $0.16 per minute for debit, prepaid, and collect calls from jails. We make this proposal based on extensive FCC staff analysis of the most recent cost data submitted by inmate calling services providers. And we use a methodology that addresses the flaws underlying the Commission‚Äôs 2015 and 2016 rates caps and that is consistent with the Communications Act. Our proposal would also cap rates for international inmate calling services for the first time. And while the Commission votes on taking these steps, I also urge our state partners to take action to address the egregiously high intrastate inmate calling services rates across the country, rates that the D.C. Circuit ruled the Commission has no authority to cap. Yet again, our August agenda demonstrates that the FCC staff will not allow their work to be significantly slowed down by the pandemic. I am grateful for their talent and determination. To my remarkable colleagues, I say, ‚Äúyou can be my wingman any time.‚Äù	"{0: {'username': 'Jim Shannon', 'date_epoch': 1627245780.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-07-25 13:43:00', 'response_content': 'Great information keep up the great work! https://www.tulsasecurityta... https://www.tulsasecurityta... https://www.tulsasecurityta... https://www.tulsasecurityta...'}, 1: {'username': 'Jim Shannon', 'date_epoch': 1630516620.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-09-01 10:17:00', 'response_content': 'https://www.tulsasecurityta...'}, 2: {'username': 'SN LIMO SERVICE', 'date_epoch': 1618659840.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-04-17 04:44:00', 'response_content': 'SN Limo Service is the Best Logan Airport Limo Service from South Shore Ma , Our Best Chauffeurs are Providing the Best Transportation on Time with Safe and Secure Livery. our Customer forgot the JB Livery and Pro Limo Type Limos or Other Then Knights Limo Like Companies.

9	Building on the Promise of Call Blocking	Patrick Webre	2020-07-09 11:30:00	1594319400.0	For some time now, stopping unwanted and illegal calls has been the FCC‚Äôs top consumer protection priority.  In addition to aggressive enforcement activity and consumer education, we have focused on creating an effective regulatory environment that enables and encourages phone companies and others to proactively stop unwanted robocalls from ever reaching customers.   In 2017, the FCC adopted new rules allowing phone companies to proactively block calls with caller ID information from telephone numbers that do not or cannot make outgoing calls. In June 2019, the FCC ruled that phone companies may block unwanted robocalls by default, based on reasonable analytics, and offer consumers more advanced tools that can block calls not on their contact lists or allow calls only from so-called ‚Äúwhite lists‚Äù of approved contacts. That focus is paying dividends.  A recent FCC report on call blocking tools finds that call-blocking technology is now substantially available at low or no cost to customers.  The report also finds that billions of unwanted calls to American consumers are being blocked each year. In surveying the tools phone companies and call blocking service providers have made available to consumers, the report identifies another important tool in the fight against unwanted calls, call labeling.  It is offered by most voice service providers in partnership with analytics companies, and displays categories for potentially unwanted or illegal calls such as ‚Äúspam‚Äù or ‚Äúscam likely‚Äù on the telephone‚Äôs screen, empowering the consumer to decide whether to answer the call. We plan to continue building on this strong foundation.  At its July 16 Open Meeting, the Commission will consider additional action to strengthen FCC call blocking policies.  The proposal being considered would, among other things, give voice service providers a safe harbor from liability for the unintended or inadvertent blocking of legitimate calls, as long as the blocking is based on reasonable analytics that include caller ID authentication.  The proposal would also further enable responsible providers to block calls from the networks of bad-actor providers that facilitate illegal and unwanted calls. Consumers can learn more about call blocking and labeling tools by visiting the FCC‚Äôs consumer guide.  Call-blocking is not the only solution the FCC is pursuing in the fight to stop unwanted and illegal calls.  We are also: Mandating that voice service providers implement the STIR/SHAKEN call authentication framework on IP portions of their networks by June 30, 2021 to help providers and consumers verify caller ID-spoofed robocalls. Helping to thwart bad-actor providers that facilitate scam robocalls.  As a recent example, in coordination with the FTC, six gateway providers were sent joint letters warning that failure to terminate COVID-19 scam robocalls within 48 hours could result in other voice service providers blocking all their traffic.  The companies complied.   Proposing a record $225 million fine for a company that apparently made more than 1 billion illegally spoofed robocalls in less than five months. Going forward, the FCC will remain vigilant and continue using every tool at its disposal to combat and prevent illegal robocalls.  For more consumer information and resources, check the FCC‚Äôs Consumer Help Center, which features consumer guides on robocalls and caller ID spoofing, and a glossary of robocall and text scams, including COVID-19 scams.

10	FCC Action Generates More Local News	Michael O'Rielly	2020-06-25 14:45:00	1593121500.0	For those of us who follow the broadcast industry closely, seeing examples of local broadcasters continuing to invest in their local news programming, and even expanding coverage, during the last few troubling months has been encouraging, though not surprising.  We should all be able to agree that coverage of local issues has rarely been more important than now, as we work together in our communities and across the country to rebuild our economy after the devastating impacts of the recent health crisis.    The success of local television news in some markets comes even as the broadcast industry in general faces monumental challenges that existed apart from COVID-19, largely due to competition from unregulated high-tech companies openly competing for the same local advertising dollars.  And, these successes come despite the obstruction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which overturned well-reasoned efforts by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to modernize outdated media ownership rules last fall.  In the face of these challenges, local news is one of the primary distinguishing features giving television stations their best opportunity to compete in today‚Äôs crowded video marketplace, and, in some cases, the best opportunity to help keep them on the air. So how exactly are broadcasters using local news to gain an edge?  While I am not endorsing any particular business model or company, one station group has taken a creative approach, and it has delivered on promises made to its Sioux Falls viewers. Earlier this year, I toured the Gray Television Washington News Bureau, a news team of about a dozen employees based in Washington, D.C., that feeds station-requested programming‚Äîincluding national coverage of the pandemic‚Äîback to all of Gray‚Äôs local television stations, which are spread across 36 states and 93 different markets, including in Sioux Falls.  Ask any Member of Congress or Senator from Appalachia, the Southeast, Great Lakes, or Midwest, and they likely know who their local Gray affiliate is, often as a result of the work of Gray‚Äôs Washington Bureau. The strategy of sharing scarce resources to improve efficiency has been emulated by Gray Television within a single market as well and has been instrumental to help keep stations afloat both during normal times and recent events.  Local viewers in Sioux Falls, prior to this year, had only three local television stations providing news, with one of the station‚Äôs newsrooms on the verge of collapse.  That station, NBC affiliate KDLT, which hadn‚Äôt yet reached the ‚Äúfailing firm‚Äù thresholds under Commission rules, was poised to lay off most of its newsroom this year if it had not been purchased by Gray and combined with the newsroom of Gray‚Äôs existing ABC affiliate, KSFY.  The buyout not only saved jobs but also led to a direct increase in local news programming and greater demand for news talent in this market.   The Commission‚Äôs approval of this small market combination was decried by critics, despite ensuring access to multiple local news outlets for viewers in eastern South Dakota.  By combining forces, KSFY and KDLT now provide viewers with non-stop news programming from four to seven PM every weekday, with an expected 3.5 hours each morning coming next year, in addition to new weekend programming‚Äîa great outcome for local journalism and coverage of important issues.  These changes were made even before the recent health matters transformed our way of life.  Since the end of March, Gray also has added a first of its kind 9 p.m. newscast for the market.  This is in addition to providing live coverage of past press conferences from Governor Noem and state health officials, along with commercial free town halls with state government officials.  None of these programming changes that helped keep South Dakotans informed about recent developments would have been possible without Gray‚Äôs acquisition of KDLT.       This combined approach has meant that viewers in Sioux Falls have access to 35 percent more unique local news hours per week, along with a newly minted news desk in the state capital of Pierre (population 14,000) and access to Gray‚Äôs Washington Bureau for perspectives on how activities in our nation‚Äôs capital affect the state.  More local programming also has meant the sale of more local ads, bolstering revenue that stays in the local community, which is especially important during this period of decreased advertising budgets.  Contrary to popular belief, this combination of stations has led to lower advertising rates for local businesses, which are seeking to regain their economic footing.  By recognizing that small television markets need flexibility that rightfully exists for some larger markets, the current Commission has shown that thinking outside the traditional media ownership box yields pro-consumer and pro-competition results. Daring to save local television stations and trying to ensure competition in small markets through this approach doesn‚Äôt come without criticism.  But promoting a positive environment for broadcasting in today‚Äôs media marketplace requires a broader perspective and a willingness to try new approaches to policy.

11	Not Alone	Ajit Pai	2020-06-24 14:30:00	1593034200.0	During the pandemic, many Americans, like me, have been binge watching television shows while staying at home.  And for 14 straight days in June, the most watched show on Netflix has been ‚Äú13 Reasons Why,‚Äù a drama about teen suicide.  There‚Äôs good reason why a suicide-themed drama is so culturally resonant at this moment.  Put simply, we are facing a suicide crisis in America.  Since 1999, the number of suicides in America has gone up 35%.  For young people, the suicide rate is rising even faster, up 56% over a decade.  We are losing an American to suicide every 11 minutes.  With these increases, we now have the highest suicide rates in the United States since World War II. Yesterday, I spoke to an online gathering of the National Council for Behavioral Health to tell them that help is on the way.  And I recently sent my fellow Commissioners draft final rules to establish 988 as a national three-digit number to access suicide prevention and mental health services.  Currently, more than two million people a year call 1-800-273-TALK to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.  Experts predict that replacing this 10-digit number with an easy-to-remember three-digit number that echoes 911 will result in millions more Americans reaching out for help that could save their lives.  While voice service providers will need to do some work to implement these new rules, under my proposal, the 988 number would be operational for Americans nationwide by July 2022, a more aggressive timeline than industry has been advocating.  I hope that my fellow Commissioners will join me in supporting 988 at our July meeting.    The Commission not only wants to make it easier to make calls that could save lives, we also want to help you avoid unwanted calls that are constantly annoying Americans and costing time and money, in the case of scams.  Year in and year out, unwanted robocalls are the FCC‚Äôs top source of consumer complaints.  Accordingly, we‚Äôve made stopping unwanted and illegal calls our top consumer-protection priority.  Among our many efforts to combat this scourge, the Commission recently proposed a record $225 million fine against a telemarketer who made approximately one billion spoofed robocalls selling health insurance‚Äîand we‚Äôve partnered with the Federal Trade Commission to force providers that facilitated the entry of illegal robocalls into our country to stop. I believe that one of the most effective solutions to this problem is call-blocking technology.  That‚Äôs why, since I became Chairman, the Commission has authorized voice service providers to block unwanted calls by default, ordered the creation of a reassigned numbers database so consumers do not get calls intended for others, and mandated caller ID authentication.  In July, the Commission will consider an Order than would provide carriers a safe harbor from liability for the unintended or inadvertent blocking of calls so long as such action is based upon reasonable analytics indicating that such calls were unwanted and therefore should be blocked.  And we‚Äôll formalize the blocking of bad actor telephone companies that act as a gateway for illegal and unwanted calls.  We will also be seeking comment on whether to obligate originating and intermediate providers to better police their networks against illegal calls, as well as to require terminating providers to provide information about blocked calls to consumers at no charge. The next item on our July agenda will build on our November 2019 Order to secure the communications supply chain‚Äîthe process by which products and services are manufactured, distributed, sold, and ultimately integrated into our networks.  In November 2019, the Commission banned the use of public funds from the Commission‚Äôs Universal Service Fund to purchase or obtain any equipment or services produced or provided by companies posing a national security threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply chain.  We also initially designated two companies, Huawei and ZTE, as covered companies for purposes of this rule, and we established a process for designating additional covered companies in the future.  Since then, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act (Secure Networks Act).  This law requires the FCC to prohibit the use of federal subsidy funds to purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain or maintain any covered communications equipment or services from certain companies.  In three weeks, we will vote on a Declaratory Ruling that would find that the Commission‚Äôs November 2019 Order fulfills this obligation.  We will also consider a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would seek comment on proposals to implement other sections of the Secure Networks Act.  As the FCC continues this important work to protect our nation‚Äôs communications infrastructure, I hope that Congress will also provide the necessary funding‚Äîwhich we estimated in November could cost up to $2 billion‚Äîfor small, rural carriers to remove and replace insecure equipment from their networks. In July, we‚Äôll also aim to strengthen the effectiveness of 911.  In an era when most 911 calls are placed with mobile phones, accurately locating where calls come from is vital to the system‚Äôs effectiveness.  In 2019, the FCC took a major step to help first responders quickly locate people calling for help from multi-story buildings when we adopted a vertical (z-axis) location accuracy metric of plus or minus 3 meters for wireless 911 calls.  In three weeks, the Commission will consider a Report and Order that would further build on this work to improve vertical location accuracy for wireless 911 calls.  This item would affirm our 2021 and 2023 deadlines for nationwide wireless providers to deploy z-axis technology in our nation‚Äôs most populated markets and call for full nationwide deployment by 2025.  This item would also give a green light to wireless carriers to deploy technologies that focus on multi-story buildings and handset-based deployment solutions that meet the z-axis metric. When disaster strikes, it is critical that America‚Äôs public safety and emergency preparedness personnel, including first responders, are able to communicate.  The Department of Homeland Security oversees three longstanding programs to help ensure that emergency workers receive prioritized connectivity to landline and wireless networks, as well as priority for service restoration, if needed.  While DHS manages these programs through contracts with participating communications providers, the FCC‚Äôs rules for two of these programs were developed decades ago when communications networks were based on legacy technologies.  It‚Äôs time to refresh and revise those rules.  So on July 16, the Commission will consider proposals to remove outdated requirements, reflect the current marketplace, and help ensure these programs meet the needs of emergency personnel today and in the future. Next on our July agenda will be another item to modernize outdated regulations, namely our leased access rules.  These regulations require cable operators to set aside channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated video programmers.  Although our regulations may have made sense when they were adopted decades ago, programmers can now choose to distribute their content on a wide variety of online video platforms, so the need for burdensome leased access rules has dramatically diminished.  Last year, we finally modernized many of our leased access rules to account for the transformation of the video marketplace after the rules were stuck in legal limbo for over a decade.  But we didn‚Äôt reach a resolution on how to modernize the leased access rate formula.  Next month, the Commission will vote on an Order that would establish a simplified tier-specific rate calculation to ease burdens on cable operators while also fulfilling our statutory obligation to establish rules for determining maximum reasonable leased access rates.    Rounding out our July agenda will be an item that will help the Commission collect granular and precise broadband coverage data from service providers.  We cannot close the digital divide and bring digital opportunity to every last American until we know where broadband is available, and where it is not.  The Commission‚Äôs current broadband mapping tool has helped us identify the least served areas in the country and bring broadband to those areas.  But as I‚Äôve long said, the maps need to be better so that policymakers and consumers alike can have confidence in them.  That‚Äôs why in 2019 the Commission adopted the Digital Opportunity Data Collection, which laid out a multi-pronged approach to developing a nationwide broadband map that will have unprecedented detail.  This past March, Congress passed the Broadband DATA Act, largely ratifying the Digital Opportunity Data Collection‚Äôs approach to broadband mapping.  At our next meeting, the Commission will consider a Second Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would begin implementing certain aspects of the Broadband DATA Act by adopting specific coverage reporting and disclosure requirements for fixed and mobile broadband providers, filing and certification requirements, and measures for determining the accuracy of broadband availability data.  It would also develop a process for engaging directly with state, local, and Tribal governments, along with consumers and other entities, to ensure that the maps are as accurate as possible.  As the FCC continues this important work, I hope that Congress will also provide the necessary funding‚Äîat least $65 million‚Äîto get our broadband mapping efforts off the ground and allow us to implement these rules. I can‚Äôt think of many meetings where we have addressed such a broad array of critical issues, from combatting robocalls to bridging the digital divide to network security to public safety.  But for all the important initiatives that we are poised to advance in three weeks, I believe the Commission‚Äôs July 2020 meeting will be remembered as a moment when the FCC came together to save lives.  Creating 988 as a national 3-digit number to access mental health services will be a game-changer for suicide prevention, and I am grateful to the FCC staff and outside partners who made it possible.

12	Removing Unnecessary Barriers and Maximizing Competition in USF Auctions	Michael O'Rielly	2020-06-18 15:40:00	1592520000.0	In striving to bring broadband access to all unserved Americans within existing funding constraints, the FCC must stretch scarce Universal Service Fund (USF) dollars as far as possible.  Distributing funding through a reverse auction is an incredibly effective mechanism in this respect and one I have long-championed: competition, on both an intra- and inter-area basis, helps drive down the funding amount needed to entice the private sector to build out broadband to areas that wouldn‚Äôt be served in the absence of government subsidies.  In implementing our reverse auctions, we should always aim to maximize participation and, in turn, competition, rather than arbitrarily limit the number of auction competitors.  One way to do this is to eliminate the condition that auction winners be designated eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs). Over the years, it has become clear to me that certain providers have been discouraged from competing for USF support to serve high cost areas due to the ETC requirement.  By way of background, the ETC designation was created by the 1996 Telecommunications Act when voice service was the telecom industry‚Äôs primary consumer offering and state commissions maintained a hefty role in regulating telephone networks.  The designation, which is a prerequisite for a provider to receive funding in accordance with section 254 of the Act, requires a company to provide basic voice service within a particular geographic area pursuant to requirements in section 214(e) and makes it subject to applicable state telecom regulations.  Procedurally, high cost funding recipients, including winners of Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF II) or Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) subsidies, must obtain such a designation from the applicable state commission prior to being authorized to receive funding. While requiring ETC status doesn‚Äôt bar participation by certain providers on its face, it serves as a major obstacle for many companies in practice.  Getting the designation itself can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, especially depending on the state jurisdiction in question.  However, that pales in comparison to the added regulatory burdens and litigation risks that come with being subject to state telecom regulation.  Individual states have specific requirements for incumbent and competitive local exchange carriers, including ETCs, covering everything from billing to service level reporting, installation, late fees, accounting standards, and customer complaint processes, which add complexity for companies that operate in multiple states or nationwide and may even conflict with providers‚Äô existing local regulatory requirements for other services in multi-product bundles.  And, the designation often introduces new burdens: take, for example, state-specific Lifeline requirements and certain states‚Äô disconnection rules that require ETCs to continue providing basic voice service to a customer despite a lengthy period of non-payment.[1]  In other words, a nationwide provider with streamlined practices would potentially become subject to a patchwork of regulations‚Äîin certain cases, upwards of 40 different regulatory regimes‚Äîeven though many of the rules entirely pre-date the modern broadband networks that our auctions are trying to subsidize, often, by several decades.  Even more significant in driving potential bidders away, becoming an ETC can involve tremendous uncertainty and unforeseen burdens.  Certain state commissions have been overzealous in expanding their regulatory reach, for example, by proposing onerous, unreasonable rules requiring carriers to report on network outages far in excess of the FCC‚Äôs existing reporting system and in a manner likely to undermine confidential consumer data.  Elsewhere, there have been attempts to mandate specific backup power requirements that would be technologically, logistically, and economically infeasible to comply with, create serious fire and safety risks, and wouldn‚Äôt even help maintain service for the vast majority of consumers.  Further, several state PUCs have improperly attempted to regulate interstate VoIP services outside of their jurisdiction, which some providers‚Äîand the FCC itself‚Äîhave successfully fought.  It would be completely backwards for these companies to turn around and seek ETC status from those very same commissions and voluntarily submit to having their VoIP service regulated as a common carrier.  And, subjecting themselves to legacy telecom regulation by becoming an ETC likely would end up prejudicing them in future legal situations involving these rogue state commissions. Compared to the burden and risk of becoming an ETC, certain providers have determined in the past and likely will again that the reward simply isn‚Äôt worth it.  The requirement is especially an obstacle for companies that might be interested in leveraging FCC subsidies to edge out to areas that are just outside their service territories but wouldn‚Äôt be seeking USF support to massively expand their footprint.  While this calculation may indeed prove to be prudent from a business perspective, it creates unfortunate consequences.  In addition to eliminating some of the most stable and qualified potential bidders from eligible census block groups, it also means fewer bidders in the Commission‚Äôs reverse auctions, thus reducing both intra- and inter-area competition.  The result is a less efficient and robust auction, giving ratepayers less bang for their buck, and the potential for certain areas to get neglected when they would have otherwise received bids. Some have argued that the FCC has authority to forbear from the ETC designation requirement on its own accord.  While that claim may have some merit, taking such action would likely be litigated by those state commissions that retain some role over telecom issues.  Rather, this is the type of issue that might be better settled by Congress.  Fortunately, the cause has garnered attention from Congress and legislation on point was introduced just last week in the House of Representatives by Congressman Butterfield (D-NC). The new bill‚Äôs plan to eliminate the outdated and burdensome ETC requirement to participate in USF auctions makes total sense.  As I have already explained, funding for the deployment of broadband‚Äîan interstate information service‚Äîshould not function as a backdoor way to expose providers to burdensome and unpredictable intrastate regulations.  In addition, I cannot think of any ongoing policy reason to maintain the requirement: the Commission already imposes its own legal, technical, and financial requirements on auction winners, not to mention extensive rules for interconnected VoIP providers outside of the auction context on everything from rural call completion to 9-1-1 obligations, and ETC status doesn‚Äôt seem to confer any additional necessary protections.  Moreover, as we know from CAF II, ETC status certainly isn‚Äôt a guarantee of providers‚Äô ability to meet service milestones.  Finally, most ironically, many states have run their own efficient and effective broadband funding programs without requiring recipients to become ETCs, increasing participation without any problematic consequences.  Those seeking to preserve the status quo (mostly state public utility commissions intent on preserving any authority they have left) would likely paint a frightening picture of what such a change would mean, and point to their role as cops on the beat to police bad behavior.  But such alarmism seems farfetched, especially when unregulated VoIP providers have been operating outside of state telecom jurisdiction for close to two decades, without creating problems.  Further, while it might be true, for example, that select state commissions may have played some role in fighting waste, fraud, and abuse in the Lifeline program, these entities have no role whatsoever when it comes to broadband, as it is an interstate service completely outside their expertise and bailiwick.  In the absence of authority to regulate broadband, their role is relegated to informing the Commission of any funding recipients‚Äô violations of FCC rules.  That‚Äôs not a cop, but a shopping mall security guard.  Additionally, having been burned in the past with respect to broadband buildout and execution failures, this Commission is paying extra attention and care to ensure USF broadband subsidy recipients meet their commitments and requirements.  Ultimately, this means that any additional entry and exit burdens imposed by a state commission are either superfluous or illegitimate. On a more fundamental level, to the extent that Congress would entertain the worthwhile idea of getting rid of new ETC requirements, perhaps this should also provoke a broader discussion around eliminating the designation entirely, including for those that already have it.  While existing ETCs are somewhat differently situated in that they affirmatively sought out and agreed to the designation, its continued application creates regulatory asymmetry in an industry that has undergone a fundamental competitive realignment. If complete elimination of the ETC designation is not in the cards, perhaps there are some other fixes to our current framework that should be adopted.  For instance, instead of the current process whereby providers must seek ETC designations from each state where they have won the obligation to serve, there should be a single, uniform application accepted in all states and a time limit for approving applications, also applicable to the FCC when designating federal ETCs.  If our country can do this for the college application process, it can be done here too.  Further, state commissions must be prohibited from imposing extraneous conditions or requirements in exchange for ETC designation over and above applicable FCC rules.  It‚Äôs one thing to allow state commissions to enforce federal standards and quite another to allow these bodies to add new obligations at their whim.  And, finally, the process for obtaining FCC broadband subsidies should make clear that a company designated an ETC by virtue of being a USF auction winner is not therefore a Title II telecom carrier, which confers a host of burdens and obligations far outside the scope of this blog.  Otherwise, the classification of broadband as a Title I Information Service could essentially be nullified by regulatory sleight of hand.   *          *          * In the end, my priority is ensuring that the Commission brings broadband access to as many unserved Americans as quickly as possible, and that means eliminating regulatory asymmetries, technology bias, and inefficiencies.  Getting rid of the mandatory, anachronistic ETC designation is certainly consistent with these objectives [1] See, e.g. 16 NYCRR ¬ß 606.4.	{0: {'username': 'Debi Mullins', 'date_epoch': 1616583000.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-03-24 03:50:00', 'response_content': 'Brother Airprint Printer Not Found'}, 1: {'username': 'Debi Mullins', 'date_epoch': 1616583000.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-03-24 03:50:00', 'response_content': 'Brother Printer Wireless Setup'}, 2: {'username': 'Debi Mullins', 'date_epoch': 1616583000.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-03-24 03:50:00', 'response_content': 'Brother Printer Drivers Support'}, 3: {'username': 'RemixMusic', 'date_epoch': 1602541380.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-10-12 15:23:00', 'response_content': 'Discographies Download is a blog for people who really love STYLE music.

13	Kickstarting the FCC's Product Marketing & Import Rules	Michael O'Rielly	2020-06-02 14:15:00	1591132500.0	The device manufacturing sector is one of the most challenging and competitive in the communications field.  As the latest devices continue to top birthday and holiday wish lists, consumers rightfully maintain high expectations since innovators have a long history of delivering wonderment.  The reality is that the newest gadgets ‚Äî used to entertain, ease our daily lives, and/or facilitate communications ‚Äî need to have near flawless functionality and amazing features.  Not surprisingly, developing new electronic devices can be a grueling process.  Getting a product from the first creative spark, through research and development, to the hardened physical unit that is ready for sale involves a myriad of steps and a rollercoaster of smiles and tears.  In the end, untold riches may await, but more often than not, new products fail miserably, as the market and capitalism work their mysterious powers to shoot down some innovator‚Äôs and entrepreneur‚Äôs best laid plans.  I believe that we can thoughtfully update FCC rules to make it easier and more affordable to bring devices to consumers while reducing investment risk without undermining any consumer protections.  For some time, manufacturers have been advocating that the FCC modernize its marketing and import restrictions, and I heartily agree that now is a perfect time for these improvements, especially given the difficult economic situation facing our country and our increasing reliance on connected devices to work, learn, shop for essential items, and stay in touch with family and friends. Specifically, our rules prohibit the pre-sale or conditional sale of radiofrequency devices, except to wholesalers and retailers.  That means, in order to market and sell the next new cell phone or other innovative device to individual consumers, the manufacturer must first seek and obtain the requisite equipment authorization from the Commission (in other words, through FCC-recognized Telecommunications Certification Bodies).  These rules may have been originally implemented to address concerns that allowing consumers to purchase pre-approved devices could jeopardize a thorough and accurate Commission review or that unapproved devices could accidentally get into the hands of consumers.  Additionally, the rules may have been intended to minimize consumer fraud, as few manufacturers would be willing to go through the equipment approval process if their ultimate goal was to scam consumers.  Or, maybe the aim was to temper the hype from new products to ensure that other FCC licensees wouldn‚Äôt be at added risk for harmful interference.  Whatever the reasons, this fifty year-old rule is past its prime in today‚Äôs commercial marketplace, where buying in advance of delivery or availability has become a common and acceptable practice.   Many real-life examples suggest that these concerns may have been exaggerated or are no longer applicable.  Since 2009, Kickstarter campaigns have allowed the public to conditionally buy products via credit card, which does not get charged if the project fails to reach its preset funding or units sold targets.  Success rates for Kickstarter demonstrate that the market and, more importantly, consumers welcome the model: $4.5 billion out of $5.1 billion pledged has been allocated, providing funding for almost 200,000 projects that reached their goals.  In another example from the auto world, Tesla actively markets and takes deposits for vehicles just barely off the drawing board.  A case in point is Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck, which consumers can reserve for a $100 downpayment: Now consider that anywhere from thousands to millions of new iPhones are sold long before they are available in stores or scheduled for delivery; before they can be marketed, however, they must complete the FCC equipment approval process.  What would be the difference or harm if they could be marketed prior to approval, but not be delivered to the consumer until FCC-approval is acquired?  I suggest there would be none.  If you can pre-order a truck, you should be able to pre-order any number of innovative new devices with endless possibilities of improving our daily lives. All we‚Äôd need to do is change our marketing rules to allow equipment manufacturers to take orders for devices and obtain financial commitments before a device has obtained Commission approval.  This would let them gauge consumer interest in a particular device prior to devoting the necessary time and resources to gain said approval.  Market research may be insightful, but it pales in comparison to actual customers putting their money on the table.  Similarly, an early, full-fledged marketing campaign may help determine how many devices will be needed in the near-term to meet consumer demand, preventing both excess and under supply when it comes time to actually sell the devices.  For small manufacturers, this could be a game changer, as it may minimize the financial risk of potential product failure and keep the entire company from going down the drain.  Even larger manufacturers could benefit, as they would have the opportunity to branch out into new product areas without huge financial commitments on the front end.  Ultimately, consumers will benefit from any added innovation, which is especially exciting as 5G is deployed further and the Internet of Things expands to everything from connected appliances to remote health monitoring devices.   Another issue is that FCC rules prevent the importation of radiofrequency devices that haven‚Äôt yet received FCC equipment authorization.  While there are exceptions for the very limited importation of devices for trade shows, testing and evaluation, and a few other specific uses, this doesn‚Äôt accommodate the large percentage of consumers that simply want to see and touch products prior to purchase.  For highly anticipated, high-demand products, however, it can take considerable preparation to have retail establishments ready for the start of marketing campaigns and actual sale of approved devices.  Lacking the ability to import a sufficient quantity of new products, for display purposes only, adds to the enormity of the challenge.  Furthermore, if the authorization is unexpectedly delayed, whole marketing and rollout campaigns can be put at risk or completely destroyed, threatening the success of a product for reasons that could be easily avoided.   A reasonable solution, and one the Commission should quickly adopt, is to allow an exception to the import rules for purposes of device advertising and retail display preparation.  Such devices can be appropriately labeled, marked, or otherwise identified to clarify that they are not available for sale; and manufacturers have suggested that other safeguards can be added, as needed, to prevent any possibility for abuse.  Doing so would give manufacturers and their partnering wireless providers the chance to have a very limited number of physical devices on hand in retail establishments that clearly couldn‚Äôt be displayed, used, or sold without completing the FCC device authorization process.   Some may try to claim that any expansion of import exceptions reduces interest in and profitability for domestic manufacturing.  I am all for producing here in the U.S., but progress on this front isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight.  And, the limited exception would have a negligible effect on overall device imports and would not in any way favor foreign manufacturing.  Moreover, as a free trade advocate, I recognize that considerable manufacturing is happening in countries that are strong U.S. allies, and that consideration shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. *             *             * An immeasurable amount of creative vision, research, testing, and so much more occurs prior to actually selling a product approved by the FCC.  The Commission can make that process a tad easier and more likely to succeed with a few tweaks to its marketing and import rules.  And, doing so wouldn‚Äôt undermine consumer or other protections one bit.  With all the massive economic difficulties now being experienced, these changes now make even more sense.	{0: {'username': 'Debi Mullins', 'date_epoch': 1616583060.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-03-24 03:51:00', 'response_content': 'Brother Airprint Printer Not Found'}, 1: {'username': 'Debi Mullins', 'date_epoch': 1616583060.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-03-24 03:51:00', 'response_content': 'Brother Printer Wireless Setup'}, 2: {'username': 'Debi Mullins', 'date_epoch': 1616583060.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-03-24 03:51:00', 'response_content': 'Brother Printer Drivers Support'}, 3: {'username': 'Shubham Singh', 'date_epoch': 1593356460.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-06-28 08:01:00', 'response_content': 'The reality is that the newest gadgets ‚Äî used to entertain, ease our daily lives, and/or facilitate communications ‚Äî need to have near flawless functionality and amazing features.

14	Bread and Butter	Ajit Pai	2020-05-18 14:15:00	1589836500.0	Since my first day as FCC Chairman, closing the digital divide has been my top priority. Meeting that priority has inspired our bread-and-butter work over the past three years. And the importance of extending Internet access to every American has never been clearer than during the coronavirus pandemic.  If you don‚Äôt have an Internet connection at home, you don‚Äôt have the option of teleworking. Your children can‚Äôt participate in distance learning. And you can‚Äôt take advantage of telehealth visits with your doctor from the safety of your own home. I‚Äôm proud that we‚Äôve made significant progress over the past three years in reducing the number of Americans without access to high-speed broadband. By removing regulatory barriers to infrastructure deployment, we‚Äôve helped bring the broadband industry‚Äôs investment in network infrastructure to the highest levels in more than a decade. From 2016 to 2018, the number of Americans without access to 25/3 Mbps fixed broadband service fell by more than 30%. During that same time period, the number of Americans with access to 250/20 Mbps fixed broadband service more than doubled. And 2018 and 2019 were record years for fiber deployment in the United States.  But despite these gains, we still have more work to do, and our primary vehicle for closing the remaining connectivity gap is our Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. Established this January, the Fund will provide up to $20.4 billion to support the deployment of high-speed broadband networks in those parts of rural America that currently lack fixed broadband service that meets the Commission‚Äôs baseline speed standards of 25/3 Mbps. At our upcoming open meeting on June 9, the Commission will be taking a major step forward with respect to the first‚Äîand largest‚Äîround of support from this program.  We will be voting on the auction procedures for Phase I of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which will target up to $16.4 billion over 10 years to deploy broadband networks in wholly unserved areas covering nearly six million unserved homes and businesses. Adopting these auction procedures now will allow service providers that hope to bid in the auction to start planning for the upcoming October 29, 2020 start date.  We are moving forward quickly in order to make sure that areas we know don‚Äôt have broadband service‚Äîwhere as many as 11.7 million Americans live and work‚Äîget it as quickly as possible.     If closing the digital divide has been my number 1 priority as FCC Chairman, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that promoting innovation and investment in 5G wireless technology has been priority 1A. And our June agenda will feature two items to help spur 5G deployment.  One key to unleashing 5G has been repurposing high-band, millimeter-wave frequencies.  Previously, these bands were considered unsuitable for broadband, but with advances in technology, we can now use these airwaves to transmit data at ultra-fast speeds and with very low latency. The Commission has already released more than 5 gigahertz of millimeter-wave spectrum for 5G, most recently by auctioning the Upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands in Auction 103, which wrapped up in March.  And I‚Äôve circulated a proposal for our June meeting to explore innovative new uses of the 71‚Äì76 GHz, 81‚Äì86 GHz, 92‚Äì94 GHz, and 94.1‚Äì95 GHz bands, collectively known as the 70/80/90 GHz bands. In particular, we will be seeking comment on potential rule changes for commercial users to facilitate the provision of wireless backhaul for 5G, as well as the deployment of broadband services to aircraft and ships, in these bands.  Because this is co-primary spectrum for federal and non-federal users, we will coordinate any proposed rule changes with affected agencies through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In addition to pushing more spectrum into the marketplace, a key component of the Commission‚Äôs 5G FAST strategy has been updating our wireless infrastructure policies to encourage private-sector investment in 5G networks.  Commissioner Carr has taken the lead on this effort, and he spearheaded an item that will be part of the Commission‚Äôs June agenda. This latest attempt to modernize our wireless infrastructure rules will clarify the Commission‚Äôs interpretation of section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act. That section provides in part that ‚Äúa State or local government may not deny, and shall approve, any eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station.‚Äù  In plain English, we want to resolve uncertainty about section 6409(a) in order to expedite the process for state and local governments to review applications to deploy wireless infrastructure.  Commissioner Carr will be issuing more details about this proposal soon. Commissioner Carr actually ran point on another item on our June agenda: a proposal to spur the transition to ATSC 3.0, the next-generation standard for broadcast TV. The digital TV transition promised to make new digital services available over broadcaster‚Äôs existing spectrum, in addition to traditional video programming. However, this potential has never been realized.  The ATSC 3.0 standard promises to finally realize the potential for broadcast spectrum capacity to support ‚ÄúBroadcast Internet‚Äù services‚Äî digital services beyond traditional over-the-air video, integrated into the broadband ecosystem. At our June meeting, we will be voting on a Declaratory Ruling that would clarify how long-standing television station ownership rules apply to the lease of spectrum to provide Broadcast Internet services. This decision would remove regulatory uncertainty that could hinder the development of new innovation using available broadcast airwaves. We will also be considering seeking comment on the extent to which the Commission should clarify or modify its existing rules in order to further promote the deployment of Broadcast Internet services as part of the transition to ATSC 3.0. Rounding out our June agenda will be an item from our Enforcement Bureau, which I am unable to discuss in greater detail at this time. As we enter our third month of social distancing, I know people are yearning for a return to normalcy. By moving forward with a new round of measures to close the digital divide and promote 5G deployment, hopefully the FCC‚Äôs June agenda will provide a dose of familiarity during these uncertain times.

15	No Slowing Down	Ajit Pai	2020-04-21 13:50:00	1587502200.0	Yesterday, a new poll came out that found more than 1 in 8 Americans used a video chat to consult with a health care professional during the past month. That‚Äôs more than double the percentage who report receiving care in an emergency room and triple the rate who went to an urgent care facility. This highlights the importance of telehealth during the coronavirus pandemic, and I‚Äôm proud of the role that the FCC is playing to expand telehealth opportunities. Thanks to Congressional action, the President‚Äôs signature, and quick work by FCC staff, the Commission has already pushed resources out the door to help healthcare providers meet the growing demand for telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Commission started accepting applications for our COVID-19 Telehealth Program last Monday, April 13. And in only three days, the Commission was able to process applications and award money for telehealth expansion to six medical facilities in hard-hit areas, from New York to New Orleans. And earlier today, we approved telehealth funding for another five healthcare providers from Michigan to California. Commission staff have done tremendous work processing these applications, and their efforts continue as they review all of the applications that we have received for this vital program. We will be approving additional funding in the days and weeks ahead‚Äîstay tuned. But that‚Äôs far from all that the Commission has been doing recently to address the ongoing pandemic. To give another example, few communities have been impacted more harshly by this national emergency than the Navajo Nation in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. So late last week, the Commission granted temporary authority to the Navajo Nation to use spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band to enhance mobile broadband access across its reservation. Of course, while the Commission focuses on our pandemic-related activities, we also must continue to advance the ongoing work of the agency. So at our May meeting, the Commission will vote on moving forward on a series of longstanding initiatives. Leading off next month‚Äôs meeting will be a Report and Order to reconfigure the 900 MHz band for the deployment of broadband services and technologies. For decades, this band has been allocated for narrowband communications like two-way dispatch radios used by business, industrial, and land transportation licensees. The draft rules would make available six of the band‚Äôs ten megahertz for the deployment of broadband services, while retaining four megahertz to continue incumbent narrowband operations. The new regulatory framework would allow 900 MHz licensees, like utilities, to obtain broadband licenses and would include operational and technical rules to minimize harmful interference to narrowband operations. To facilitate the quick transition to broadband services, we would use a market-driven process that primarily relies on negotiated agreements between interested parties. As with wireless broadband for utilities, so too with ships and planes. Our May agenda will also include a vote on new rules to expand the use of Earth Stations in Motion, or ESIMs, which transmit data from satellites to moving vehicles like ships, airplanes, or school buses. I saw the impact this connectivity can have on a trip to Moab, Utah, where students in remote, rural regions of the school district were able to do homework and take tests online during multi-hour bus rides. In 2018, the Commission adopted rules to make it easier for geostationary-satellite orbit (GSO) satellites to target ESIMs. And next month, we will vote on an Order to allow ESIMs to communicate in additional frequency bands with GSO satellites. The draft rules would also allow ESIMs to communicate with non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites, which is important as several companies are in the process of launching new NGSO constellations. American consumers want and expect to be connected wherever they are, and this plan will open new market opportunities to connect vehicles on land, on sea, and in the air. Aside from closing the digital divide and promoting innovation, perhaps the most frequent subject of monthly agenda items over the past three years has been modernizing the Commission‚Äôs outdated media regulations. Our May meeting will feature our latest attempt to inject common sense in our rulebook by streamlining our rules for public notice of the filing of broadcast applications. Current FCC rules require radio and TV broadcasters to notify the public before and after they file certain license applications. The types of required notice are inconsistent based upon the type of applicant, type of station, and type of application. For example, notices can either be over the air or in a local newspaper, and there are requirements on the type of newspaper. Moreover, the current notices are clunky and lengthy, and give consumers little guidance on how to access the applications and file comments or objections to them. The result is an increasingly complex system that makes compliance costly and much more difficult than it needed to be. In three weeks, the Commission will vote on rules to require shorter and more uniform public notices for all broadcast stations. Our goal is twofold: to make it easier for the public to meaningfully participate in the broadcast licensing process and to make the process easier for broadcasters. Notices will be simpler and transition from newspaper to websites, better reflecting how consumers access information these days. The simpler notices will direct consumers to the Commission‚Äôs Online Public Inspection File and existing Commission databases, where they can access the applications in question and comment on them. This brings our notification process into the 21st century and offers consumers more opportunities for engagement. Last but not least, we‚Äôll tackle an important task that enables us to keep the lights on. Unlike most federal agencies, the FCC actually covers its own operational costs by assessing fees on companies we regulate. The Commission is required by Congress to assess regulatory fees each year in an amount that can reasonably be expected to equal the amount of its appropriation. At our May meeting, the Commission will vote on a plan to collect $339,000,000 in regulatory fees for fiscal year 2020. Notably, we are proposing a new fee for foreign-licensed space stations that have access to the U.S. market. The Commission spends resources regulating these space stations, so it‚Äôs only fair that the foreign space stations, just like U.S. space stations, help pay for the Commission‚Äôs operations. Yesterday, the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management sent a memo to the heads of federal agencies with preliminary guidelines on how to ‚Äúramp back up government operations to the maximum extent possible.‚Äù This will be no problem for the Commission, because, as our May agenda and the totality of our efforts over the past two months make clear, the FCC has shown no signs of slowing down. Thanks again to everyone at the FCC for rising to this challenge.  	{0: {'username': 'mortonamice', 'date_epoch': 1593568620.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-06-30 18:57:00', 'response_content': 'Would certainly you such as all to be on the dance flooring or even considering the most effective music for a perfect dance or even searching for DJ tracks for enjoying yourself and amusement 24/7?

16	Digging In for the Long Haul	Ajit Pai	2020-04-01 14:35:00	1585776900.0	For the past three weeks, the FCC‚Äôs highest priority has been tackling the immediate challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have gotten more than 650 broadband and telephone service providers to take my Keep Americans Connected Pledge, which protects consumers whose lives have been disrupted by the pandemic from disconnection or late fees and opens up providers‚Äô Wi-Fi hotspots to anyone who needs them. Many of those providers have gone even further, upgrading speeds at no charge, improving low-cost or free offerings for low-income Americans and students, lifting data caps, and more. We‚Äôve granted temporary authority to multiple wireless carriers to use additional spectrum to meet increased consumer demand. We‚Äôve made an additional $42 million immediately available to expand telehealth services in rural hospitals and clinics, in addition to many other actions. And just this week, we established a bold, new $200 million COVID-19 Telehealth Program to address the urgent needs of health care providers and patients across the country. As we continue our important work directly related to COVID-19, the FCC will also continue our work confronting the longer-term challenges that have been highlighted by pandemic. In particular, at our upcoming meeting on April 23, we will be voting on major initiatives to expand wireless connectivity and further close the digital divide. Not long ago, being effectively confined to our homes for the foreseeable future would have been difficult to imagine. Now try to imagine what this new era of social distancing would look like without Wi-Fi. Before anyone had heard of COVID-19, Wi-Fi carried more than half of the Internet‚Äôs traffic, and offloading mobile data traffic to Wi-Fi was vital to keeping our cellular networks from being overwhelmed. Wi-Fi is the fabric that binds together all our devices. Americans want and need faster, stronger Wi-Fi networks. The good news is that the next generation of Wi-Fi, commonly called Wi-Fi 6, has started rolling out. It will be over two-and-a-half times faster than the current standard. For some time, I‚Äôve talked about the potential of Wi-Fi 6 to deliver value to the American consumer. Today, I‚Äôm taking a critical step to making that potential a reality. I‚Äôve shared with my colleagues my plan to unleash next-generation Wi-Fi‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa plan that one champion of innovation has called, ‚Äúwithout a doubt the single biggest opportunity in Wi-Fi‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand probably in wireless‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin a generation.‚Äù Specifically, I have proposed a set of rules to make 1,200 megahertz of spectrum available for unlicensed use in four segments of the 6 GHz band (5.925‚Äì7.125 GHz). This band is currently populated by, among others, microwave services that are used to support utilities, public safety, and wireless backhaul. So unlicensed devices will share this spectrum with incumbent licensed services under rules that are carefully crafted to protect those licensed services and to enable both unlicensed and licensed operations to thrive throughout the band. Ultimately, I expect that 6 GHz unlicensed devices will become a part of consumers‚Äô everyday lives. For the rules we will vote on would play a major role in the growth of the Internet of Things, connecting appliances, machines, meters, wearables, and other consumer electronics, as well as industrial sensors for manufacturing. In addition to the Report and Order, we‚Äôll consider a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to explore possibilities for very low power devices in this band. Better, faster Wi-Fi is a good thing. But cellular technologies are important, too. In fact, recent increases in telework, distance learning, and telehealth services reveal the importance of both kinds of wireless innovation, unlicensed and licensed. That brings me to a topic I‚Äôve talked a lot about during my time as Chairman: 5G. In the not-too-distant future, access to mobile broadband will mean access to 5G. 5G has the potential to bring many benefits to American consumers and businesses, including wireless networks that are more responsive, more secure, and up to 100 times faster than today‚Äôs 4G LTE networks. But we need to make sure that 5G narrows rather than widens the digital divide, and that rural Americans too benefit from the wireless innovation on our doorstep. That‚Äôs why the Commission‚Äôs April meeting will feature a plan to establish a 5G Fund for rural America. This proposal would use multi-round reverse auctions to distribute up to $9 billion, in two phases, to bring 5G service to rural areas of our country. Phase I of the 5G Fund would target at least $8 billion of support over ten years to rural areas of our country that would be unlikely to be covered by the commitments made by New T-Mobile as part of its acquisition of Sprint (including coverage of 90% of rural Americans with 5G service at 50 Mbps or greater over the next six years) and that we anticipate would not see timely deployment of 5G service absent universal service support. To balance our policy goal of efficiently and quickly redirecting high-cost support to areas where it is most needed with our obligation to ensure that we have an accurate understanding of the extent of nationwide mobile wireless broadband deployment, we seek public input on two options for identifying areas that would be eligible for 5G Fund support. Another huge new opportunity to close the digital divide in rural America comes from major advances in satellite-delivered broadband. The Commission is moving forward with two important initiatives to unlock the potential of this technology. Here‚Äôs the context. Instead of sending one large satellite into a high orbit, we can now send a whole bunch of them into low- or mid-Earth orbit. These non-geostationary satellite orbit, or NGSO, constellations will create a mesh network of satellites in space that hold the potential to provide consumer-focused residential broadband at a speed and price-point that is competitive with terrestrial broadband offerings. However, one downside of dramatically increasing the number of new satellites in orbit is the risk of increased orbital debris. And as we know from the movie ‚ÄúGravity,‚Äù in space, even a centimeter-wide object can wreak devastating damage. In three weeks, the Commission will therefore vote on a Report and Order to comprehensively update the Commission‚Äôs existing rules regarding orbital debris mitigation, which were adopted in 2004. These new rules are designed to address the problem of orbital debris, while at the same time not creating undue regulatory obstacles to new satellite ventures. We would also seek comment on adopting a performance bond tied to successful spacecraft disposal. To promote new and expanded services using NGSO constellations, the Commission is committed to giving every company a fair shot at innovating and competing in the U.S. market. That‚Äôs why we have already approved a number of applications for this new generation of low-Earth orbit satellite constellations. And at our April meeting, the Commission will vote on an Order to approve ViaSat‚Äôs request for market access for a constellation of 20 satellites that will provide fixed-satellite service. Making sure advanced communications are available to all Americans means making sure they are accessible to Americans with disabilities. Video description makes television programming accessible to the blind or visually impaired by inserting an audio description of the program. The Commission‚Äôs rules currently require certain commercial television broadcast stations in only the top 60 television markets to provide video-described programming. I have shared a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that tentatively concludes we should expand the Commission‚Äôs video description regulations by phasing them in for an additional 10 markets each year for the next four years. The NPRM also proposes that the Commission seek further comment in 2023 on whether to expand its video description to markets beyond the top 100 after 2024. Rounding out our April agenda will be a Report and Order to update our technical rules for Low-Power FM (LPFM) stations. There are now over 2,100 LPFM stations, and the LPFM have matured since engineering requirements were first established in 2000. This maturation means that LPFM stations should be able to take advantage of additional engineering options to improve reception. That‚Äôs why the Commission will be voting on new rules to improve reception and increase flexibility while maintaining interference protection and the core LPFM goals of diversity and localism. These reforms include expanded LPFM use of directional antennas and permitting LPFM use of FM booster stations. During this difficult time, broadcasters of all sizes have been critical in providing their communities with up-to-date information, and LPFM stations have certainly done their part. Like WNQZ-LP in New Orleans, which has been carrying locally produced public service announcements. Or WOMP-LP in Cambridge, Ohio, which has been carrying local church services, serving the elderly and low-income Americans who are particularly isolated and lack access to streaming services. And KDRT-LP in Davis, California, which stepped up to serve its community after the local college radio station was forced off the air by the pandemic. These are just a few examples of how the LPFM service has risen to the challenge presented by COVID-19. The FCC‚Äôs work to meet the challenges posed by COVID-19 will continue full speed ahead in April. But as this full agenda makes clear, the coronavirus pandemic won‚Äôt stop the FCC from also getting our work to meet the longer-term challenges highlighted by the pandemic. Thank you to all of the Commission staff who worked on these important matters under trying circumstances. And to everyone out there: Stay vigilant. Stay healthy. And stay home.

17	FCC Makes Funds Available to Reimburse Eligible LPTV/Translator Stations For Displacement Facility Costs	Jean Kiddoo	2020-03-26 12:15:00	1585250100.0	During these uncertain times when local TV broadcasters are reporting that they are facing financial challenges arising from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and yet still playing a vital role in making critical healthcare information available to their viewers, we thought it appropriate to provide an update on the status of the post-Incentive Auction transition. We are pleased to share the good news that we today announced an initial allocation of over $87 million from the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund for low power television (LPTV) and TV translator (together LPTV/Translator) stations. This allocation enables us to begin reimbursing approved invoices submitted by eligible LPTV/Translator stations displaced by the Incentive Auction for costs they have incurred related to the construction of new or modified facilities. Repacked TV stations have been working hard since the auction closed in April 2017 to assure that the post-Incentive Auction transition has kept on schedule. We are in the 9th phase of a 10-phase transition. 848 out of 987 total repacked TV stations nationwide (over 85%) have already vacated their pre-auction channels, over 82% of those using permanent facilities. As a result, T-Mobile has reported that it has already been able to commence operation on much of its nationwide 600 MHz spectrum covering 200 million people, with some of that spectrum being used to provide 5G. In addition, consistent with the Commission‚Äôs efforts to keep Americans connected during the coronavirus pandemic, the Commission recently granted T-Mobile authority to use additional spectrum in the 600 MHz band licensed to other carriers as a result of the Incentive Auction to help it add capacity that will allow Americans to participate in telehealth, distance learning, and telework, and to remain socially connected while practicing important social distancing. TV and radio stations are also playing a crucial part in assuring that Americans stay connected to local and national news and alerts during these difficult times, and we recognize that construction, delivery, and other delays to their transition efforts may occur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, while we‚Äôve already had some phase 9 stations complete their transitions notwithstanding these challenges, we recently advised repack TV stations assigned to phase 9 that if a station believes it can‚Äôt meet the May 1, 2020, deadline, we will grant it a waiver to the phase 10, July 3 deadline. Importantly, however, while there may be a construction delay for some stations, our Fund Administrator and staff have continued to process and approve invoices from all eligible full power and Class A repack stations and FM stations promptly so that they are reimbursed for their eligible costs without any delay during these uncertain times. With our most recent action today, we will now be able to commence reimbursement payments to certain LPTV/Translator stations who were displaced by the rebanding and repacking process as a result of the Incentive Auction and commencement of service by forward auction winners. We received 947 eligibility submissions from LPTV/Translator stations and, together with our Fund Administrator, determined that 844 satisfy the statutory eligibility criteria. The aggregate reimbursement demand for all the LPTV/Translator stations that filed estimates was $164,922,143, and the verified total amount of estimates for stations determined to be eligible was $102,437,198. Our initial allocation to each eligible LPTV/Translator station represents 85 percent of each station‚Äôs verified cost estimates in recognition of the fact that there are factors that may exert upward pressure on the total amount of verified cost estimates, and we will monitor closely the drawdown of the Fund as well as revisions to initial cost estimates to determine if additional allocations are warranted. It is therefore important that eligible LPTV/Translator stations seeking reimbursement timely submit invoices after incurring costs. LPTV/Translator stations may immediately begin submitting documentation of actual expenses incurred for approval to be drawn down against their individual allocations by uploading invoices or receipts and resubmitting the reimbursement form in the Bureau‚Äôs Licensing and Management System. Invoices for actual expenses incurred that have already been submitted will also be reviewed and processed for payment upon approval. LPTV/Translator stations should also be aware that while there was no deadline for submission of Form 1876 banking instructions, payments cannot be made until a station‚Äôs Form 1876 has been approved ‚Äì a process that can take several weeks. Especially in these unprecedented times, we thank the broadcasting industry, equipment vendors, tower workers, and other partners for their hard work during the post-Incentive Auction transition. These efforts are an important element to accomplishing the Commission‚Äôs mission to align spectrum use with the 21st century consumer‚Äôs demand for wireless, 5G, and broadband services.

18	Stepping Up to the Coronavirus Challenge	Ajit Pai	2020-03-24 11:30:00	1585074600.0	Like most Americans, my daily life has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. I‚Äôm staying at home as much as I possibly can (exceptions for the grocery store and pharmacy). I‚Äôve been teleworking, which has been a big change from the norm. And my kids are home, too‚Äîso I‚Äôve been spending time teaching math, going over reading, and empathizing with this Israeli mom. Juggling the demands of work and family has been a day-by-day, sometimes hour-by-hour challenge, as CNBC‚Äôs Becky Quick memorably captured. Both my parents and parents-in-law are older, so we‚Äôve been worrying about and remotely checking in on them, constantly reminding them to be safe and stay at home (an unexpected reciprocation of the messages conveyed a quarter-century ago). No doubt about it‚Äîthe changes wrought by the pandemic have been jarring. I‚Äôm sure this is true for many of you, too. But I have it lucky. Thus far, knock on wood, my immediate family is healthy. Not everyone has been so fortunate. I‚Äôve been thinking about all the families who have lost loved ones to this virus, often without getting the chance to say good bye‚Äîincluding the former superintendent of the school district I attended in southeast Kansas. I‚Äôve been thinking about friends who have become ill with the virus, one of whom‚Äîa brilliant lawyer who is younger than me‚Äîis in critical condition. And aside from health concerns, I worry for everyone who was suddenly laid off and faces an uncertain future‚Äîfolks who work at restaurants, retail stores, sports arenas, and many other places. But I‚Äôm also grateful for all the acts of compassion and dedication that this pandemic has inspired‚Äîespecially from those who have done and are doing heroic work to enable the rest of us to function. From the grocery store employees and food producers to the police and firefighters to those who keep the lights on and water running, there are a lot of people who are working overtime to meet the needs of their communities. And most of all, as the husband of a physician who used to work on infectious disease at the National Institutes of Health, I have a keen appreciation for the sacrifices of all the doctors, nurses, and public health officials who are caring for others, often putting themselves at risk. Another silver lining is that I‚Äôve got the chance to work with an incredibly talented, determined team at the Federal Communications Commission. Communications technologies are uniquely positioned to make a positive difference during this unprecedented moment, and my co-workers have done a lot to make this potential a reality. It might be hard to find hand sanitizer and toilet paper, but I‚Äôm happy to report that Internet access is proving to be one of the most valuable non-medical commodities right now. Thanks to the Internet, tens of millions of Americans (including me) are able to work from home while still honoring the social distancing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Schools may be closed, but students are still learning with the help of online tools and instruction. As we try to minimize the stress on hospitals, telehealth tools can help Americans receive needed medical care. And whether it‚Äôs FaceTiming parents or sharing videos of Italians singing from their balconies or penguins touring an empty Aquarium, being online helps satisfy our need for human connection while we‚Äôre staying apart from others. I‚Äôm committed to using every legal means at the FCC‚Äôs disposal to help Americans deal with the coronavirus pandemic. And so far, we‚Äôve demonstrated that commitment in many notable ways. Most importantly, I developed the Keep Americans Connected pledge to make sure that nobody loses broadband and telephone service when they need it most. Under the terms of the Pledge, broadband and telephone providers are stepping up to the plate and making three key commitments to American consumers: (1) No residential or small business subscribers will have their service terminated over the next 60 days because of an inability to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic; (2) Any late fees incurred by residential or small business customers because of their economic circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic will be waived during this period; and (3) Wi-Fi hotspots will be opened up to any American who needs them. I‚Äôm pleased that over 500 broadband providers, serving hundreds of millions of Americans, have signed this pledge, and the number of providers keeps growing. I also challenged our nation‚Äôs broadband and telephone service providers to go above and beyond the commitments in the Keep Americans Connected Pledge in order to meet the connectivity needs of the American people, and I‚Äôm grateful that many have done so. These offerings include free service for low-income Americans and students, lifting data caps, and increasing broadband speeds at no cost to meet the increased demand for telework and distance learning. The FCC has compiled a list of some of these offerings to help consumers see what‚Äôs available. I applaud these companies for taking these steps, and taking them quickly, to ensure that our transition to telework, telehealth, and remote learning is smoother than it otherwise would be. I‚Äôve also been in touch with America‚Äôs television and radio broadcasters. As they long have done in times of crisis, they‚Äôve committed to playing a key role in making sure the public is informed on how to respond to COVID-19. In particular, they are airing a series of public service announcements to, among other things, encourage social distancing. Notably, these PSAs are also available in Spanish. Beyond the Keep Americans Connected Pledge, the FCC has done a lot to cut through regulatory red tape and free up resources to enable access to communications for those impacted by COVID-19. To promote telehealth solutions for the patients of rural hospitals and clinics, the Commission voted to make an additional $42 million immediately available through our Rural Health Care Program. To preserve vital communications for individuals who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, or deaf-blind, or have a speech disability, the Commission has granted temporary waivers that will allow American Sign Language interpreters to work from home and maintain relay services. To promote connectivity for hospitals and students, the Commission temporarily waived so-called ‚Äúgift rules‚Äù so participants in its Rural Health Care and E-Rate programs can solicit and accept improved connections or additional equipment for telemedicine or remote learning. To help low-income consumers stay connected, the Commission temporarily waived certain requirements from our Lifeline program, which will ease burdens on Lifeline subscribers and allow Lifeline carriers to focus their efforts on assisting customers. To meet increased consumer demand for mobile broadband, the Commission granted temporary authority to AT&T, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon to use additional spectrum in the 600 MHz, AWS-3, and AWS-4 bands. To prevent possible disruptions in service, especially for rural consumers, the Commission granted a temporary extension to hundreds of wireless Internet service providers in the 3650-3700 MHz band to transition their existing operations to the Citizens Broadband Radio Service rules. To accommodate construction and delivery delays for television stations transitioning to new channels after the incentive auction, the Commission has agreed to provide more flexibility under the Transition Scheduling Plan. None of this important work would have been possible without the determination of the outstanding public servants at the FCC to make it happen. On top of that, the other trains are still running on schedule. On St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, the Commission successfully hosted an online meeting of our preeminent public safety advisory panel‚Äîthe Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council. I‚Äôve held a number of virtual meetings with FCC staff and/or outside parties using conference bridges. And we are still on track to adopt the multiple monthly agenda items this month. We‚Äôve found a way to stay productive amidst the changes around us. I‚Äôll close on a high note. I recently read an interview that The Los Angeles Times did with immortal baseball announcer Vin Scully. At 92, he‚Äôs seen pretty much every curveball this country has faced over the past century. Here‚Äôs what he said about the times in which we find ourselves: ‚ÄúFrom depths of depression we fought our way through World War II, and if we can do that, we can certainly fight through this. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the life of the world, the ups and downs, this is a down, we‚Äôre going to have to realistically accept it at what it is and we‚Äôll get out of it, that‚Äôs all there is to it, we will definitely get out of it.‚Äù Amen, Mr. Scully. We‚Äôll keep connected, we‚Äôll stay focused‚Äîand we‚Äôll definitely get out of it.

19	Robocall Relief Springs Forward	Ajit Pai	2020-03-09 13:55:00	1583787300.0	"This past weekend, Americans across the country lost time that they're never getting back, had their sleep disrupted, and complained about this injustice. No, I'm not talking about springing our clocks forward for Daylight Savings Time. I'm talking about one of the few constants of American life that are even worse: unwanted robocalls. Unfortunately, I can't give back that hour that we lost in the wee hours on Sunday morning, but I can announce that meaningful relief is on the way against robocalls. Because of ""spoofed"" robocalls, Americans often look at the caller ID information on their phones and are tricked into thinking that the call is from someone in their community‚Äîeven if it's a robocall from another country. But thanks to caller ID authentication technology known as STIR/SHAKEN, phone companies can verify the accuracy of the caller ID information that is transmitted with a call. Widespread implementation of this technology would help phone companies identify calls with illegally spoofed caller ID information before those calls reach their customers' phones. In other words, you'd have a lot more peace of mind when you pick up the phone. Last year, I demanded that major phone companies voluntarily deploy STIR/SHAKEN, and a number of them did. But it's clear that FCC action is now needed to spur across-the-board deployment of this important technology. At our March meeting, the Commission will therefore vote on new rules requiring implementation of STIR/SHAKEN by June 30, 2021, a deadline set forth in the TRACED Act, which was recently passed by Congress. Under my proposal, the FCC would also seek public input on additional measures to combat spoofed robocalls, including other measures to implement the TRACED Act. At our March meeting, we are looking not only to spur the deployment of new technologies to make phone service more consumer-friendly, but also to get outdated and unnecessary telephone regulations off the books. In light of the multitude of options that American consumers now have for voice service, I'm proposing to examine whether certain pricing and tariffing regulations that the FCC imposed on incumbent phone companies when they held a monopoly on local telephone service still make sense today. Specifically, I've circulated a proposal to deregulate and detariff what I'm calling ""Telephone Access Charges,"" which are the last handful of interstate end-user charges that remain subject to FCC regulation. Under this proposal, the FCC would also prohibit all carriers from separately listing these charges‚Äîan alphabet soup of charges like the Subscriber Line Charge, the Access Recovery Charge, the Presubscribed Interexchange Carrier Charge, the Line Port Charge, and the Special Access Surcharge‚Äîon customers' bills. Eliminating these line-item charges would make it easier for consumers to understand their phone bills and compare prices among voice service providers as well as help ensure that a carrier's advertised prices are closer to the prices that consumers actually pay. We will be rounding out our March agenda with a trio of items from our Media Bureau. The first is a proposal to make it easier for broadcast TV stations to use a distributed transmission system, or DTS. DTS uses multiple transmitter sites within a station's authorized service area, each operating on the same channel, in order to provide better service to the public. Among its benefits, DTS technology makes it easier to serve hard-to-reach viewers, improves indoor and mobile reception, and uses TV spectrum more efficiently. As the discerning reader may recall, the FCC majority allowed and encouraged the broadcast television industry to innovate by developing and deploying the next generation broadcast television standard (ATSC 3.0)‚Äîessentially an Internet Protocol-based broadcast technology that could deliver richer video content on more devices for consumers. That deployment is now on our doorstep, with broadcasters announcing plans to, by the end of 2020, activate ATSC 3.0 stations in the largest 40 TV markets and release 20 ATSC 3.0 compatible TV models in stores. But there are concerns that the Commission's current rules inhibit expanded DTS deployments with the new standard. I've circulated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, based on a proposal by America's Public Television Stations and the National Association of Broadcasters, that seeks comment on whether and, if so, how to modify the DTS rules to ensure that broadcasters planning to deploy ATSC 3.0 are able to use DTS effectively. Specifically, we would look at amending the Commission's rules to permit, within certain limits, DTS signals to spill over beyond a station's authorized service area by more than the currently allowed ""minimal amount."" Next up, we'll consider a proposal to change the Commission's rules governing the resolution of program carriage disputes between video programming vendors and multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs). We propose modifications to time-limit requirements for filing complaints and effective dates for decisions by our Administrative Law Judge, which are designed to provide additional clarity to both potential complainants and defendants, as well as adjudicators. We are also seeking to harmonize our rules, where possible, for the resolution of program carriage, program access, retransmission consent, and open video system (OVS) complaints in these areas. I am optimistic that these changes would help ensure an expeditious program access, program carriage, retransmission consent, and OVS complaint process. Finally, we'll take up a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine modernizing the methodology for determining whether a television broadcast station is ""significantly viewed"" in a community outside of its local television market and thus may be treated as a local station in that community for broadcast signal carriage purposes. Our significantly viewed stations rules currently rely on market survey data from Nielsen. However, it appears as though Nielsen's survey systems no longer align with our rules, making it difficult to demonstrate that a station is significantly viewed. In some markets, this data is not even available, making it difficult, if not impossible, to meet the standard. Given marketplace changes since the current process for determining a station's significantly viewed status was adopted nearly 50 years ago, this NPRM examines whether this process has become outdated or overly burdensome, particularly for smaller entities, and if so, what changes we should make to our rules. Unfortunately, I can't do anything about the hour of sleep people lost this past weekend, but I can say that the Commission is moving forward with multiple proposals to provide relief from outdated regulations and, more important, unwanted robocalls.

20	The 3.5 GHz Auction Is Finally a Go!	Michael O'Rielly	2020-02-07 13:45:00	1581108300.0	At the February 2020 open meeting, the Commission is scheduled to vote on procedures for the 3.5 GHz Priority Access License, or PAL, auction. Having taken the lead on the issue, I'll admit that it has been a long road to get here, but this important step represents one of the last actions the Commission needs to take to make these critical mid-band licenses available for 5G and other next-generation wireless services. Ultimately, this auction will provide the first new, mid-band licenses for 5G (albeit with inferior power limits), and it is expected that, given the importance of mid-band's capacity and propagation, it will provide a spectrum foothold for those deploying these next-generation networks. Yet, since this CBRS structure is the first of its kind to incorporate licensed and unlicensed-like opportunities, it is of interest to a wide variety of users. It took a lot of work and compromise to fix the misguided licensing structure left over from the last Commission and to make licenses more attractive to a diverse assortment of potential bidders. This meant addressing the needs of traditional commercial mobile providers, utilities, private network users, fixed wireless providers, cable operators, the unlicensed community, and so many more. In the end, the final compromise offers county-sized licenses‚Äîfar smaller than the Commission's normal size‚Äîin 10 megahertz blocks that are renewable like our traditional licenses, providing all potential applicants with the confidence needed to bid, invest, and deploy networks without the fear of capital investment being stranded. Licensees need the assurance that if they build, follow the rules, and put their spectrum into use to serve the American people, then they will not be at risk of losing their licenses in the future. For those familiar with FCC processes, most of our auction procedures will look very similar to those we have used in the past. There is no need to reject a structure that has been a smashing success. One mechanism, however, that was planned for this auction in the Comment Public Notice did not make the cut. CMA-level bidding, which was part of the Comment Public Notice, and would have facilitated an applicant's ability to bid on licenses covering all the counties within a CMA, was opposed by a number of interested parties, and will not be implemented. It is important to note, this proposal would not in any way have changed the license size from county to CMA, provided a price break for CMA-level bidders, or changed the rules they needed to follow. Put another way, it was simply intended and designed to make the bidding process easier for those wanting coverage over a larger area. While I am not convinced by some of the arguments made against CMA-level bidding, throwing it overboard should neither alter bidding practices nor decrease the bidding pool. Thus, I asked Chairman Pai to jettison it as part of this new Public Notice. Going forward, we will need to revisit the package bidding issue for future, unrelated auctions. Hopefully, the artificial limitations presented by the software will no longer hamper us in this respect. Bidders should be able to select which counties they want to include in a bidding package and not be shoehorned into a package designed by the Commission based on what is easiest to program in our software. This would allow bidders to pick those licenses and areas that they prioritize, and, therefore, assuage the concerns raised by many commenters. Regardless, the CBRS Procedures Public Notice will get us to the June 25, 2020 auction. I am beyond pleased that we now have all the pieces in place for what I anticipate will be a successful auction, and I thank the Chairman for his leadership in getting us to this point. While there are still some outstanding issues that ought to be reconsidered in this band, such as ways to reduce the protection area sizes and increasing power limits, the auction is not dependent on these being resolved at this exact moment. Moreover, we may need to consider how to mitigate the potential of harmful interference occurring between future C-Band licenses and CBRS users as well. I will certainly be pushing hard to make these changes a reality as soon as possible. Now, let's get to the PAL auction!  	{0: {'username': 'mortonamice', 'date_epoch': 1592874660.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-06-22 18:11:00', 'response_content': 'Regardless of what sort of songs you love to listen closely or what exactly you desire, whatever your preference is, if you are searching for first class without paying just about anything or carrying out any kind of procedure, only believe on the suggested one may your criteria will be met.

Many of these changes have received broad bipartisan support within the Commission and among interested parties. Notwithstanding this success, much work remains. While I have certainly sought to carry out more comprehensive media rule reforms through this proceeding, it is equally important to address issues that might be characterized as smaller in scope. After all, any justified relief is a step in the right direction. In that vein, I will respectfully request that the Chairman pursue certain modifications to the Commission's Program Carriage Rules, which enable video content producers to challenge negative carriage decisions by multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs). Moreover, we can and should move to eliminate an outdated recordkeeping requirement pertaining to cable operators' attributable interests in video programming. In particular, I submit that we should fix a seemingly minor loophole in the life of any program carriage complaint. Under existing Commission rules, the clock for a complaining party to file a complaint is tied to the initial notification provided to the MVPD of the complainant's intent to file with the Commission, not when the offending action actually occurred. This means that even if the questionable behavior happened a decade ago or more, an allegedly aggrieved party can still pursue a complaint with the Commission at any time, so long as it does so within one year of notifying the targeted MVPD. This is beyond ridiculous. We should change our rules so that the program carriage statute of limitations begins to run from the date of the alleged violation, in particular, the date of denial of a request for carriage or the failure to acknowledge such a request. Doing so would in no way undermine the actual program carriage rules nor short-circuit complainants' program carriage rights. It would simply provide a modest level of regulatory certainty, while harmonizing the process with our time limitations on related matters, including good faith requirements in the retransmission consent context and program access complaints. As long as we are correcting the program carriage process, the Commission should also clean up another procedural issue arising from the current complaint process. Under current rules, initial decisions by an Administrative Law Judge usually become effective upon release. This has often proven problematic, forcing cable providers that have not prevailed in a case to take immediate remedial action, even as the provider may seek‚Äîand perhaps ultimately prevail on‚Äîan appeal of the ALJ's ruling. Such a remedial process as currently exists can force immediate lineup changes, adding costs and potential confusion for current subscribers, and even more so in the case where a provider wins on appeal and must make changes for a second time. Accordingly, it makes considerable sense to automatically stay these initial decisions until parties have had the opportunity to pursue challenges before the full Commission. This doesn't prejudice or harm any ""winning"" programming complainant, as the option for a discretionary Commission-issued stay in such circumstances already exists. In yet another example of unnecessary and obsolete burdens, Commission regulations continue to require cable operators to maintain records of their attributable interests in video programming services and carriage of any such vertically integrated video programming services on their cable systems. Despite such ownership generally waning over time, this mandate has a bigger problem: it was originally crafted to aid the Commission's larger and separate mandate‚Äîsince struck down by the courts‚Äîlimiting a provider's channel occupancy for its vertically integrated video programming. In short, the recordkeeping rule is a holdover mechanism to help enforce a provision the courts have killed off and the Commission has never resurrected. Why should we require the collection and reporting of data pertaining to ownership of video programming when the underlying obligation it was intended to serve is no longer operative? Continuing to do so amounts to a waste of time and resources. While it's likely any of these worthwhile changes would need to go through the formal notice and comment process, we should be able to complete such rulemakings fairly quickly, assuming no significant disagreements among the Commissioners. I am hopeful that Chairman Pai will put these ideas before the full Commission for consideration.

22	Kicking Off the New Year in a Big Way	Ajit Pai	2020-01-08 15:40:00	1578523200.0	This week, I and 170,000 of my closest friends are kicking the new year into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. This annual pilgrimage for high-tech enthusiasts offers a glimpse into our digital future. Like the many entrepreneurs with booths on the show floor, the FCC is committed to helping unleash the breakthroughs of tomorrow. And one important part of our mission is equality of digital opportunity‚Äîwe want all Americans to benefit from these breakthroughs. For that to happen, they need access to high-speed broadband networks. Since I became Chairman in January 2017, we've made considerable progress in making high-speed broadband available to more Americans. In 2018, for example, fiber was deployed to more new homes in the United States than any year since they've been keeping track. And in 2019, we beat that 2018 record for fiber deployment, setting an all-time high for the second straight year. But our work isn't yet done. So today, I'm sharing with my fellow commissioners a draft order that would establish the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, a modern approach for connecting those hardest-to-serve corners of our country. At the FCC's January open meeting, we'll vote on this order‚Äîour biggest step yet to close the digital divide. The new Fund will provide up to $20.4 billion over the next decade to support the deployment of high-speed broadband networks in those parts of rural America that currently lack fixed broadband service that meets the Commission's baseline speed standards. To maximize the impact of these investments, we will use a multi-round, descending-clock reverse auction. The Commission used this same reverse-auction approach in 2018 for Phase II of our Connect America Fund, and it helped us fund the deployment of high-speed broadband to 713,000 unserved rural homes and businesses for just 30% of our projected cost. And we don't want millions of rural Americans to wait longer than necessary to obtain the economic, educational, and healthcare opportunities provided by high-speed broadband. That's why I'm proposing that we divide the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund into two phases. Phase I would provide up to $16 billion to fund the deployment of high-speed broadband in census blocks where we know that there's not any service available meeting the Commission's baseline speed standards. Based on our initial estimates, almost 6 million homes and businesses in rural America would be eligible for Phase I of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. And then, once we complete our efforts to update our broadband maps to more precisely identify connectivity gaps, we will move forward with Phase II, which will cover unserved households in census blocks where some households are served, as well as areas that don't receive funding in Phase I. We also want to prioritize the deployment of broadband networks that will meet the needs of tomorrow as well as today. Congress has called on the Commission to fund sustainable and forward-looking networks that will stand the test of time. I agree. That's why, in addition to more than doubling the minimum speed required of bidders in the Connect America Phase II auction, I'm proposing a significant additional measure to favor the deployment of faster services. Once the reverse auction in Phase I hits the clearing amount of $16 billion, a bid to provide faster service to an area will automatically be chosen over a competing bid to provide slower service to that same area. The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund has the potential to transform the lives of millions of our fellow citizens in rural America and revitalize parts of our country that are currently being left out of our digital economy. That's why I hope that my colleagues will join me on January 30 in supporting this bold initiative. Just as we want all Americans to have access to high-speed broadband service, we want the tens of millions of Americans with hearing loss to have access to advanced smartphones, like everybody else. The Commission has long-standing rules that require both manufacturers and service providers to make available handsets that meet specified technical criteria for hearing-aid compatibility. In 2019, the American National Standards Institute adopted new technical specifications, but the Commission's rules are still based on outdated standards from 2011. To reflect technological advances, I'll call a Commission vote at our January meeting on a proposal to incorporate the new standard into our rules. For Americans with more severe hearing loss, Video Relay Service, or VRS, has been critical to helping them use American Sign Language to communicate with voice telephone users. To improve the effectiveness of this vital service, the Commission launched a pilot program in 2017 to allow qualified sign-language interpreters to work as communications assistants from home workstations as opposed to requiring them to work at call centers. The pilot has shown that in-home interpreters can work as efficiently and effectively as those in call centers and that our safeguards can both impede waste, fraud, and abuse and maintain the privacy of communications.  That's why I've proposed to my colleagues to make the at-home call-handling program permanent. The year on the calendar might have changed, but one thing that hasn't is the Commission's drive to update rules as part of our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative. The central idea behind this effort has been to match our rules to the realities of the current media marketplace, and a recurring theme of this effort has been replacing wasteful and costly paper notifications with electronic notifications. Currently, cable and satellite operators must provide broadcast TV stations with notice by paper delivery before they take certain actions. For example, cable operators must give notice by paper before they commence service in a market or delete or reposition a broadcast station. Satellite television providers must similarly give notice by paper prior to retransmitting certain stations or launching new services into a market. Last July, we proposed making these paper notices electronic instead. Commenters unanimously supported this common-sense idea, and, in three weeks, the Commission will vote on an order that will require these notices to be transmitted electronically. Rounding out the Commission's first open meeting of 2020 will be an item from our Enforcement Bureau. You'll have to check back on January 30 to get the details. For the fourth year running, my biggest New Year's resolution at the office was to work to bridge the digital divide and provide more Americans digital opportunity. With the Commission's January agenda, we're set for a great start toward achieving that goal. Here's wishing everyone a happy and healthy new year!

23	911 in 2019: A Look Back and a Look Ahead	Lisa M. Fowlkes	2019-12-23 10:00:00	1577120400.0	As 2019 draws to a close, it‚Äôs once again time to recap what the FCC has done to strengthen America‚Äôs 911 system over the past year and highlight what‚Äôs to come.  While our work is technically complex, our overriding goal is simple: all Americans should be able to reach 911 and be located by first responders during an emergency. Helping First Responders Locate 911 Callers in Multi-Story Buildings In November, the FCC adopted rules that will help first responders locate people who call 911 from wireless phones in multi-story buildings, such as many apartments and offices.  The new rules will help emergency responders determine the floor level of a 911 caller, which will reduce emergency response times and ultimately save lives. Specifically, wireless providers must transmit the caller‚Äôs vertical location, within three meters above or below the phone, to the 911 call center. This requirement will help emergency responders more accurately identify the floor level for most 911 calls.  It is also achievable, which will keep the deployment of vertical location information to public safety officials on schedule, beginning in April 2021. We‚Äôre gratified by the widespread support for this decision from the public safety community, including the International Association of Fire Fighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of State EMS Officials, the National Sheriffs‚Äô Association, NENA: The 9-1-1 Association, and the National Association of State 911 Administrators.  The FCC also invited public comment on establishing a timeline for even more stringent vertical location accuracy, including ultimately requiring wireless providers to deliver the caller‚Äôs specific floor level.  We will continue to monitor technological progress towards these goals and encourage stakeholders to provide input. Helping the Public Call 911 from Multi-Line Telephone Systems In August, the FCC adopted rules to help ensure that people who call 911 from multi-line telephone systems‚Äîwhich commonly serve hotels, office buildings, and campuses‚Äîcan reach 911 and be quickly located by first responders.  The FCC implemented Kari‚Äôs Law, which requires multi-line telephone systems to enable users to dial 911 directly, without having to dial a prefix (such as a ‚Äú9‚Äù) to reach an outside line.  Kari‚Äôs Law also requires multi-line telephone systems to provide notification, such as to a front desk or security office, when a 911 call is made in order to facilitate building entry by first responders.  Kari‚Äôs Law would not have been enacted without the tireless efforts of Hank Hunt, who was often joined by Chairman Pai in advocating for direct dialing to 911.  Now that it is the law of the land, and we‚Äôve adopted rules specifying how companies can effectively meet their statutory obligations, our focus turns to promoting awareness and ensuring compliance with the rules that will go into effect next February. Improving Emergency Response for 911 Calls Across Technology Platforms Also in August, the FCC adopted rules to ensure that ‚Äúdispatchable location‚Äù information‚Äîsuch as the street address, floor level, and room number of a 911 caller‚Äî is conveyed with 911 calls, regardless of the technological platform used, so that first responders can be quickly dispatched to the caller‚Äôs location.  The new rules, which implement Section 506 of RAY BAUM‚ÄôS Act, apply dispatchable location requirements and timelines to multi-line telephone systems, fixed telephone service, interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, Telecommunications Relay Services, and mobile texting services.  Promoting 911 Reliability The Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau issued a report detailing the cause and impact of a nationwide CenturyLink outage that disrupted 911 service for approximately 17 million Americans in December 2018.  Our report, issued after a thorough investigation, outlined lessons learned from the incident and identified network reliability best practices that could have prevented or mitigated the effects of the outage.  We continue to work with major providers to discuss the application of industry-accepted best practices in their networks and are offering assistance to smaller providers to help ensure that our nation‚Äôs communications networks remain robust, reliable, and resilient Shining a Light on 911 Fee Diversion Just last week we sent our 11th annual report to Congress on the collection and expenditure of 911 fees on the state and local level.  These reports contain a wealth of information about the status of 911 funding and deployment across the country, including identifying the handful of states that use 911 fees paid by the public for non-911 purposes.  We support transparency around the unfortunate practice of 911 fee diversion, and you can read the report on our website. Streamlining Our 911 Rules Also, while it may not generate headlines, it‚Äôs still noteworthy that the FCC consolidated its 911 rules from multiple rule parts into a single rule part this year, which will make it easier for stakeholders, such as service providers and emergency management officials, to more easily determine 911 requirements. Looking Ahead Next year will continue to be a busy one in our ongoing effort to strengthen emergency calling.  For example, although we focused a great deal this year on identifying the vertical location of 911 callers, our work overseeing improvements to 911 horizontal location accuracy continues.  Wireless providers must meet a tough horizontal accuracy benchmark in April 2020, and we be closely monitoring their progress.  Last, as we always emphasize, America‚Äôs 911 system relies on the hard work of a wide range of stakeholders beyond the FCC‚Äîincluding public safety organizations, government partners, communications providers, technology vendors, and public interest groups.  Many on the front lines, including emergency responders and 911 telecommunicators, will be working throughout the holidays to keep their communities safe.  Thank you for service, and I wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season.	{0: {'username': 'RemixMusic', 'date_epoch': 1595705100.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-07-25 12:25:00', 'response_content': 'Be MP3z ‚Äì Download MP3 Music & Tracks Now a days when each particular person on this planet earth desires to throw a occasion he‚Äôs always in need of latest new greatest DJ Remixes songs as it‚Äôs most important thing which engages company within the social gathering.

24	OET Chief Julius Knapp Announces Retirement	Julius Knapp	2019-11-27 11:00:00	1574877600.0	"It is with a heavy heart that I announce my retirement from the FCC on January 3, 2020. I have loved working for the FCC over a career spanning 45 1/2 years. I thank Chairman Pai and all the past Chairmen and Commissioners for whom I have had the privilege to serve. Most of all I am grateful for having had the opportunity to work with the fantastic staff in the Office of Engineering and Technology and the other bureaus and offices throughout the Commission. I'm sure some may wonder, why I would choose to retire now when there is so much left to do. As many people are aware, I've been considering retiring for several years and actually hit the maximum retirement benefits long ago. To nobody's surprise, there will always be more things to accomplish and that will never change. As George Harrison once said in his hit song: ""All Things Must Pass."" There remains an outstanding team of engineers, attorneys and professionals in the Office of Engineering and Technology who are up to speed on all of our many projects. I take comfort in knowing that everything is in great hands. Nevertheless, I will miss the many people I have gotten to know in the communications sector. My wonderful wife Debi and I plan to spend more time with our family and enjoy our ""golden years."" I am also looking forward to achieving my lifelong ambitions of hitting cleanup for the Yankees, leading the PGA tour golf leaderboard and playing guitar and keyboard as lead vocalist in a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band. Well, maybe I will at least have time to watch others do those things. In the meantime I will be working full steam ahead to support the Commission's work in my remaining time at the Commission.

25	A Small Number, A Big Difference	Ajit Pai	2019-11-20 14:20:00	1574284800.0	"The last Federal Communications Commission meeting of 2019, on December 12, features more than one item that could receive top billing in an ordinary month. But at the top of the agenda is something that I hope will be seen in time as one of the most consequential decisions of this Commission. That's because I'm confident it will save countless lives. In 2017, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline received more than two million calls from people seeking help. Now consider that 10.6 million American adults seriously thought about committing suicide that same year. 1.4 million Americans attempted it. And tragically, 47,000 Americans died by suicide. Suicide rates in America are rising and have reached the highest levels we've seen since World War II. Even though many are currently receiving life-saving counseling, there are millions more who need it but aren't reaching out. The evidence and common sense tell us that if we make it easier for people to call for help, more people will get the counseling they need. That is exactly what the Commission is poised to enable. As I announced this past Tuesday at the National Council for Behavioral Health, I've circulated a proposal to move forward with the necessary steps to establish 988 as a national 3-digit number to access suicide prevention and mental health services. Under my proposal, anyone calling 988 would be routed to the established National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK), which is already saving lives. I believe that an easy-to-remember 3-digit number for emergency suicide prevention and mental health services would result in more people reaching out for assistance and would help to combat this crisis. The second item on the Commission's December agenda involves a proposal to provide dedicated spectrum for both advanced automotive safety technology and unlicensed uses like Wi-Fi. In 1999, the FCC allocated 75 megahertz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for a service called Dedicated Short-Range Communications. Commonly known as DSRC, this technology was intended to enable transportation-related communications, including vehicle-safety applications. Unfortunately, after two decades‚Äîan eternity, considering the other digital innovation we've seen‚ÄîDSRC has barely been deployed, meaning this spectrum has been largely unused. In my second speech of the week, I previewed a plan to take a fresh look at the 5.9 GHz band and set a path for the deployment of new services. In particular, I've proposed making the lower 45 MHz of the band available for unlicensed uses like Wi-Fi. Since its launch, Wi-Fi has become a staple of everyday life. Wi-Fi now carries more than half of the Internet's traffic. It has become a foundational technology for the Internet of Things, connecting our TVs, thermostats, baby monitors, refrigerators, washing machines, toys, and even toilets. We therefore need to make more spectrum available for unlicensed use to meet growing consumer demand. At the same time, my plan would allocate the upper 20 MHz of this band for a new automotive communications technology, Cellular Vehicle to Everything, or C-V2X. This new technology would use cellular protocols to provide direct communications between vehicles, and, as the name suggests, everything‚Äîincluding other vehicles on the road, infrastructure like light poles, cyclists, pedestrians, and road workers. We also propose to make an additional 10 megahertz available for transportation-related communications, for a total of 30 megahertz, and invite comment on whether it should be used for DSRC or C-V2X. If adopted, my new plan for this band would make far more productive use of this spectrum, and would deliver far more value to American consumers, than the status quo. In addition to the 5.9 GHz item, we will consider a second proposal on our December agenda regarding mid-band spectrum. In March 2018, Congress passed a law calling for the exploration of commercial uses in the 3.1-3.55 GHz band. Currently, the Department of Defense operates high-powered radar systems in this band, with some non-federal users offering radiolocation services on a secondary basis. To prepare the upper portion of the band for potential shared use between commercial wireless services and federal incumbents, I'm proposing to remove the existing non-federal secondary radiolocation and amateur allocations in the 3.3-3.55 GHz band and relocate those services to the 3.1-3.3 GHz portion of the band or other frequencies. Clearing this upper portion of the band of existing non-federal operations could help us make as much as 250 megahertz of spectrum available for advanced wireless services. This would promote the development and deployment of 5G services across the country and advance American leadership in this next generation of wireless connectivity. Next up, we'll have an item that will help encourage the ongoing transition from legacy voice networks to Internet Protocol-based networks. Traditionally, the Commission has indirectly subsidized the construction and operation of telephone networks through a complicated system of rules known as intercarrier compensation. One of these rules allows local phone companies (or LECs) to charge long-distance companies for delivering long-distance calls to customers on the LEC's network. But as more and more telephone calls are carried on both the traditional phone network‚Äîknown as the public-switched telephone network‚Äîand IP-based networks, and as more and more consumers look to alternatives to traditional phone service like voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), it raises questions about which carriers should be able to collect these charges. At our December meeting, the Commission will consider a Declaratory Ruling interpreting what is known as the VoIP symmetry rule. The prior Commission's interpretation of this rule (over my dissent) was rejected by the D.C. Circuit, and this Declaratory Ruling would take a different tack. Specifically, it would determine that LECs may assess end-office switched access charges if, and only if, the local carrier or its VoIP partner provides a physical connection to the last-mile facilities used to serve an end-user. This all sounds very complicated to the uninitiated, but the thing to know is that this will help ensure that carriers have the right incentives to deploy modern, IP-based networks throughout our country. Rounding out our December meeting will be two media items. The first seeks to make sure consumers are accurately informed and not confused when there are disputes between broadcasters and cable programmers, on the one hand, and cable operators, on the other. Americans are all-too-familiar with retransmission consent and program carriage negotiations that come down to the wire‚Äîsometimes days or even hours before the existing agreements expire. Under current rules, cable providers must give consumers 30 days' notice before a channel goes dark if the change is within a provider's control. However, the problem is that most retransmission and program carriage disputes are resolved within the 30-day window before agreements expire, which creates a significant problem. Specifically, we don't want consumers to be inundated by premature and inaccurate notices about channel changes that never come to pass. And our rule begs the question whether the failure to reach an agreement in the 30 days before a contract expires is within a cable operator's control. After all, as the saying goes, it takes two to tango. So to make consumer notices more meaningful and accurate and to make our rules clearer, we will consider a proposal to change the notice deadline from 30 days in advance to ""as soon as possible"" in cases in which carriage negotiations fail during the last 30 days of a contract. The second media item would tweak our licensing process for noncommercial educational full-service FM and full-power television (NCE) and low-power FM (LPFM) broadcast stations. The proposed changes build upon lessons learned from the most recent NCE and LPFM filing windows and are designed to improve our comparative selection and licensing procedures, expedite the initiation of new service to the public, eliminate unnecessary applicant burdens, and reduce the number of appeals of our NCE comparative licensing decisions. The Commission will also consider three enforcement items at our December meeting. Because we cannot discuss enforcement actions before they are adopted, I can't share any further details about these actions at this time. With Thanksgiving a week away, I'll close by thanking all of the Commission staff for their outstanding work on our December agenda‚Äîand indeed, all year long. I've said repeatedly that the Commission's top-notch staff is our greatest asset. They do the heavy lifting that makes the lives of the American people better in meaningful ways. A cornucopia of gratitude to them, and here's wishing everyone a happy start to the holiday season.

26	Setting the Standard for Rural Connectivity	Ajit Pai	2019-10-03 11:40:00	1570128000.0	Two weeks ago, I ventured to North Dakota to kick off a road trip that wound through South Dakota, Nebraska, and, eventually, the greatest state in the Union‚ÄîKansas.  This was just the latest of my many forays outside the beltway to learn first-hand about the challenges facing the people and places on the wrong side of the digital divide.  This excursion was particularly memorable for me because it means that I‚Äôve now been to all 48 states in the continental United States as Chairman.  My biggest takeaway from these trips has been the inspiration I‚Äôve drawn from meeting the men and women doing the hard work to bring digital opportunity to their communities.  Time and again, they‚Äôve reinforced the importance of closing the digital divide and making sure that every American can enjoy the benefits of the Internet age. One way in which the FCC has been focusing on this is working to ensure that broadband networks‚Äîand the digital opportunity they bring‚Äîreach every American. But deploying broadband is more than just the physical connections between customers and service providers; it is also making sure that those networks are delivering the performance customers expect.  So, we must also demand that these new digital connections are fast and responsive enough to support online applications. Rural Americans shouldn‚Äôt have to settle for second-rate service, and taxpayer support shouldn‚Äôt go toward shoddy service, either. That‚Äôs why the FCC sets performance standards for the recipients of universal service support, that is, if you get money from the FCC, you have to prove that you‚Äôre using that money to deliver digital opportunity. Over the past several months, the Commission has been reviewing our testing procedures for measuring whether carriers receiving support from our Connect America Fund high cost program are building networks that meet the performance standards we have set. On one hand, we want to make sure that subscribers are getting the quality of service that they have been promised and our rules require. On the other, we also want to make sure that our testing procedures don‚Äôt impose unnecessary burdens on small carriers located in hard-to-serve areas that often face unique challenges.  Today, I‚Äôm circulating an order addressing testing procedures and performance measures that strikes the right balance. This order, which we‚Äôll vote on at our upcoming October 25 meeting, would maintain those requirements necessary to ensuring that carriers receiving universal service support are meeting our performance standards and providing subscribers the quality broadband service they deserve.  But it would also give providers greater flexibility where it makes sense to do so. For example, it would change testing implementation dates so that they are now more closely aligned with when a carrier has its first mandatory build-out obligations. It would also create a pre-testing period that would allow carriers to ensure that their testing systems are performing correctly before testing begins. We expect that this added flexibility will reduce burdens on broadband providers without compromising the effectiveness of our testing regime. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this order. Speaking of not placing undue burdens on service providers, more than a decade ago, Congress passed a law prohibiting state, local, and Tribal governments from imposing higher 911 fees on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services than traditional telecommunications services.  Nevertheless, we‚Äôve seen litigation in Alabama and other states over whether VoIP business service subscribers can be charged higher 911 fees than subscribers to traditional telecommunications services. At our October meeting, the Commission will vote on a Declaratory Ruling clarifying that placing discriminatory fees on VoIP subscribers is prohibited and providing examples of fees that would be discriminatory and thus legally prohibited. This ruling would not only assure regulatory parity between VoIP and traditional telecommunications services, it would also encourage consumers and businesses to migrate to more advanced, IP-based services. Just as the Commission‚Äôs rules should reflect how IP-based services have changed the marketplace for voice services, they should also acknowledge the ways they are revolutionizing the video marketplace.  Under the Cable Act, the regulation of basic cable rates is only permitted in those areas where there is not effective competition in the video marketplace. And because of the vast changes in the video marketplace that have taken place over the last two or three decades, cable rate regulation in the United States is now limited to certain parts of Hawaii and Massachusetts.  Charter has asked the Commission to find that it is subject to effective competition in the Hawaii and Massachusetts communities that it serves. Specifically, it points to the over-the-top streaming service offered throughout the country by AT&T, which provides video programming bundles comparable to those provided by cable operators.  In three weeks, the Commission will vote on an order that would agree Charter is now subject to effective competition from AT&T‚Äôs streaming service. Adopting this order would be a major step toward the Commission recognizing the realities of the modern video marketplace, and the increasingly important role that streaming services are playing in it.   Turning from outdated cable regulations to outdated broadcast regulations, during World War II, the Commission adopted regulations regarding the use of common antenna sites. This was a time when shortages of equipment and materials were a serious impediment to the introduction of new broadcast services. Today, however, this is obviously not the case. Moreover, the number of radio and television stations have increased substantially in the last 75 years as have the number of sites where broadcast antennas are located. As a result, there is now a serious question as to whether the Commission‚Äôs common antenna site regulations remain necessary. So at our October meeting, the Commission will be voting on a proposal to seek comment on whether we should revise these rules or eliminate them altogether. Believe it or not, there‚Äôs an even older set of rules slated to be featured on the Commission‚Äôs October agenda. The FCC has rules governing tariff filings that go back more than 75 years when tariffs were often voluminous and filed exclusively in hard copy. This month, we will consider an order addressing two regulations that don‚Äôt make sense in an era when tariffs are filed and can be accessed electronically and lengthy review periods are no longer necessary.  First, we would allow carriers to cross-reference their tariffs as well as those of their affiliates, ending a long-standing prohibition on this practice. Second, we would eliminate the requirement that price cap carriers file certain supporting information‚Äîknown as ‚Äúshort-form tariff review plans‚Äù‚Äî90 days before their annual interstate access charge filings are effective. Rounding out our October agenda is an item to accelerate the conclusion of the Commission‚Äôs 800 MHz band reconfiguration program. This 14-year initiative has aimed to eliminate interference that once plagued first-responders operating in the band. With this re-banding effort nearing the finish line, I am proposing that we eliminate requirements that are no longer necessary and will only serve the purpose of delaying the end of this already lengthy process. In closing, congratulations to all Nationals‚Äô fans on Tuesday night‚Äôs come-from-behind victory. As someone who roots for Kansas City sports teams, I can certainly empathize with your suffering over the years.  ust five years ago, the Royals had an improbable 8th-inning comeback of their own in a wild card game, and I‚Äôm glad so many of my friends and neighbors got to share that feeling of joy and long-overdue relief.  Good luck against the Dodgers tonight and for the rest of the playoffs.

27	Storming Back Stronger	Ajit Pai	2019-09-04 14:10:00	1567631400.0	For several days, Hurricane Dorian battered the Bahamas with devastating winds, rain, and storm surge, and now it is close to our southeast coast.  My thoughts are with everyone who is in harm‚Äôs way and our neighbors in the Bahamas whose lives have already been upended by this historic tragedy.  This situation has led us to focus our energies at the FCC on working with our federal and state partners as well as industry to prepare for and mitigate Dorian‚Äôs impact in the United States.  Among other efforts, the Commission has already activated our system for monitoring and reporting network outages, and we‚Äôre helping to ensure that coordinated plans are in place to expedite any needed service restoration. Unfortunately, Dorian is not the first natural disaster to spur the FCC into action, nor will it be the last.  For example, two years ago this month, Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands within a span of two weeks.  In addition to massive property destruction, power and communications outages were widespread.  The Commission acted quickly, providing an infusion of about $66 million from the Universal Service Fund to assist carriers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with initial restoration efforts.  Then, in 2018, we created the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and Connect USVI Fund.  For Stage 1 of these funds, we provided about $64 million in additional funding to assist with network restoration.  That support was critical to the carriers‚Äô efforts to restore their networks.  And for Stage 2, we proposed a longer-term strategy for improving, expanding, and hardening broadband networks throughout the islands.  Today, I shared with my colleagues a draft Order that would finalize Stage 2 of the Funds, allocating about $950 million to improve, expand, and harden broadband networks in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  We will be voting on this draft Order at the FCC‚Äôs monthly meeting on September 26.  Now that most carriers have largely restored service, it is time to authorize long-term funding to ensure that everyone in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has access to the same high-speed fixed and mobile broadband networks as other Americans.  And at the same time, we must storm-harden those communications networks so they can withstand the future hurricanes that will undoubtedly come and will continue to function when Puerto Ricans and Virgin Islanders need them most.  I‚Äôm particularly pleased that the draft Order would create incentives for the deployment of gigabit-speed fixed broadband and 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity, on the islands.  My goal is simple: I want everyone in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to be connected with digital opportunity. At our September meeting, we‚Äôll also consider final rules to combat a persistent problem known as ‚Äúaccess arbitrage.‚Äù  Despite FCC reforms in 2011, bad actors still game our existing intercarrier compensation system and increase their access charge revenues (in other words, make money) by purposely and inefficiently inflating high-volume call traffic‚Äîlike ‚Äúfree‚Äù conferencing calling or chat line traffic.  Long-distance carriers‚Äîand their customers‚Äîend up footing the bill for these ‚Äúfree‚Äù services.  So, we‚Äôll vote on rules to eliminate the incentives to engage in these wasteful arbitrage schemes.  Specifically, we would shift financial responsibility for paying these excessive access charges to the carriers that are responsible for stimulating them. In three weeks, the Commission will also take another step forward in our work to promote American leadership in 5G wireless services.  Making more spectrum available for the commercial marketplace is a central plank of the Commission‚Äôs 5G FAST strategy.  We‚Äôve already completed two spectrum auctions this year and will begin a third on December 10.  And at our September meeting, we will vote to seek comment on draft procedures for an auction of 70 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band to begin on June 25, 2020.  The 3.5 GHz band is prime spectrum for 5G services.  But when I became Chairman, we didn‚Äôt have the right rules in place to encourage the deployment of 5G in the band.  That‚Äôs why I asked Commissioner O‚ÄôRielly to lead our effort to adopt targeted updates to the licensing and technical rules for the 3.5 GHz band with the aim of promoting more investment and innovation.  Thanks to Commissioner O‚ÄôRielly‚Äôs leadership, we put the rules in place last year that will facilitate the deployment of 5G in the 3.5 GHz band.  And we are now ready to start the process that will lead to the 3.5 GHz auction commencing next June.  Our September meeting will also feature the latest chapter in our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative.  Specifically, I am proposing to replace the requirement that broadcast licensees and applicants file notices in local newspapers when they file certain applications with the Commission with a requirement that they instead post online notices that would directly link to the applications themselves.  I am also proposing to simplify the announcements regarding these applications that broadcasters must make over the air, and to have these announcements direct the public to online resources where they can review these applications.  This is just another example of how we are modernizing our media rules to reflect the digital age and streamlining them to eliminate unnecessary red tape.    Rounding out this month‚Äôs agenda is a draft Order to reform the Commission‚Äôs rules governing direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service.  The Commission recently streamlined its processing procedures for certain satellites, but the procedures for DBS satellites, those most commonly used to deliver satellite TV, were not updated.  At our September meeting, we will therefore vote on aligning our DBS processing procedures with the procedures for other types of satellites.  Taking this step will facilitate increased use of spectrum and orbital resources, while protecting existing consumers of satellite television from harmful interference to their services. In closing, I would like to thank all of the emergency responders who have been working around the clock in response to Hurricane Dorian.  It‚Äôs still unclear how this storm will impact the southeast coast, but I know for certain that our nation‚Äôs first responders will rise to the challenge, like they always do.	{0: {'username': 'S√†n G·ªó An Pha', 'date_epoch': 1589515800.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-05-14 21:10:00', 'response_content': 'Becare full my friend.

If you wish to speak with our executive, then press ""one"" now. (That was an invalid entry.) [Preceding two sentences repeated.] * Phone numbers bleeped in audio files for consumer protection. The FCC receives more complaints about unwanted phone calls than any other consumer issue. Stopping illegal robocalls and scam calls is at the top of my priority list. I'm reminded of that every day, because, like you, I get these calls too. So does everyone at the FCC, even on our work phones. Accompanying this post are audio clips and transcripts from two of the voicemails I received. The FCC advises consumers not to answer calls or respond to texts from unknown numbers. But this summer, the scam callers were persistent, leaving voicemails that threatened legal action if I didn't call back. Our guidance is: Never call back an unfamiliar number, because it may lead to a scam. Of course, I didn't call back, but the voicemails were unsettling nonetheless. You can listen to audio and read transcripts from two of the voicemails I received. In a new Consumer Help Center series, we are breaking down phone scams and including scam audio when it's available. Our goal is to help consumers not only understand how the scams work, but also to hear how the scams sound. We began providing audio with a recent post on Medicare card scams. In the voicemails I received, the calls sounded urgent, pressuring me to take action to avoid legal and financial consequences. That's often the case with these types of scams, though call-back messages may also sound friendly or routine. Don't give in to fear or curiosity. A scammer's first goal is to engage you, then they go to work on stealing your money or your valuable personal information. Here's some additional information to help you avoid falling victim to a scam: Be on guard for spoofing scams, where caller ID information is falsified. Scammers may spoof a local area code and number, a company you know and trust or even a government agency to trick you into picking up. If you answer a call and suspect it was spoofed, hang up immediately. Do not respond to any questions or requests. Never reveal personal or financial information. If you feel pressured or suspicious, hang up and call back using a number you can verify on a bill, an account statement or an official website. As part of our multi-pronged approach to stopping unwanted and illegal robocalls, some of the FCC's recent actions include: Allowing phone companies to block by default illegal or unwanted calls based on reasonable call analytics before the calls reach you. Allowing phone companies to provide consumers with tools to block calls from any number that doesn't appear on a customer's contact list or other ""white list."" Banning malicious caller ID spoofing of text messages and calls originating overseas. Urging phone companies to implement caller ID authentication to help reduce illegal spoofing. To help you avoid robocall scams, I encourage you to take advantage of the latest protections available and ask your phone company about robocall-blocking tools and apps. Several phone companies recently pledged to offer their customers call blocking and labeling tools for free, in addition to other actions they agreed to take to reduce unwanted robocalls. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai voiced his support for these commitments and noted that they align with the FCC's own anti-robocalling and spoofing efforts. Also, please share this blog post with friends and family so they'll become familiar with the tactics used in voicemail call-back scams. And let us know when you get unwanted calls, especially if you suspect someone is trying to scam you. File a consumer complaint at fcc.gov/complaints. Your feedback informs our future action."

29	When Opportunity Knocks	Ajit Pai	2019-07-10 16:25:00	1562801100.0	As is often the case, the current pop culture landscape in the United States is being dominated by sequels. ‚ÄúToy Story 4‚Äù and the latest Spider-Man movie are lapping the field at the box office. The third edition of ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù was streamed by a record 41 million Netflix subscribers in the first four days since its release on July 4. An abundance of sequels is nothing new. What‚Äôs extraordinary about this moment is that these follow-ups are being almost universally recognized by critics and audiences as being really, really good. In this season of better-than-ever revivals, the FCC is introducing at its upcoming August 1 meeting a new-and-improved sequel of its own: the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. If the FCC were a movie studio, its tentpole franchise would be its universal service programs. Across multiple decades and many iterations, the Commission has operated programs that have invested billions of dollars so that millions of unserved Americans can access phone and, more recently, Internet (a hat tip to former Chairman Genachowski there) services. This April, I joined the President at a White House event, where I announced my plans to create the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, a modernized approach for connecting the hardest-to-serve corners of our country. Today, I‚Äôm circulating a proposal to formally establish this program. If adopted, the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund will mark the Commission‚Äôs single biggest step yet to close the rural digital divide and will connect millions more rural homes and small businesses to high-speed broadband networks. The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund would build on the success of the Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction. Thanks to our reforms, the latter program will connect over 700,000 unserved rural homes and businesses with high-speed broadband for just 30% of our projected cost to reach these areas. And over 99.5% of these locations will have access to at least 25 Mbps broadband, with many homes and businesses receiving gigabit connections. Under my proposal, the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund would take a similar approach in providing $20.4 billion over the next decade to support high-speed broadband networks in rural America. In particular, I‚Äôm proposing to disburse support in two phases using a multi-round, descending-clock reverse auction. This will ensure that the most unserved Americans will be covered for the lowest cost possible. Phase I would target those areas that we already know are wholly unserved. Then, Phase II would target (1) any areas not won in the first phase and (2) those areas that are partially served once the Commission has more granular information about which areas are already served (that is, we‚Äôll target unserved households in a census block that is otherwise served, sort of like filling in the white spaces of a picture). My proposal would increase the minimum speed from 10/1 Mbps in the last auction to 25/3 Mbps, and it would favor faster services with lower latency, like gigabit Internet access. My proposal would also open the auction to all types of Internet service providers, such as rural telephone companies, small cable providers, fixed wireless companies, and electric cooperatives. One of the long-term improvements of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund will be better targeting to make sure investments go to areas where the need is the greatest. That brings me to the next item on our August agenda. When it comes to understanding where broadband is available and where it isn‚Äôt, the FCC‚Äôs primary data source, known as Form 477, lets us see which census blocks have broadband coverage. But just because some homes and businesses in a census block have access to broadband doesn‚Äôt mean all of them do. That‚Äôs why I launched a proceeding during my first year as Chairman to find ways to collect more granular data about where broadband is deployed. And that‚Äôs why today, I‚Äôm proposing the Digital Opportunity Data Collection, an all-new approach to mapping that will collect granular broadband availability maps from service providers using shapefiles. But we won‚Äôt just be taking their word for it: I‚Äôm also proposing that we verify those maps through crowdsourcing ‚Äî feedback directly from the public. If a provider can‚Äôt provide the service shown on its map, you‚Äôll be able to tell us directly. This process will let us better target our scarce universal service funds where they are needed most. Our August agenda will feature a third item aimed at closing the digital divide in rural America and ensuring that we‚Äôre stretching universal service dollars as far as possible. The FCC‚Äôs Rural Health Care program provides financial support to help rural health care providers obtain communications services at discounted rates for telehealth services ‚Äî services that benefit patients living in and around these rural communities. The Commission will be voting on a package of much-needed changes to this program. The most significant of these changes is to the way we calculate the rates that health care providers must pay and the amount of support they will receive. Right now, it is difficult for health care providers to determine these amounts ‚Äî and for the Fund Administrator to verify them. As a result, the assessment, distribution, and receipt of support can be slow and uncertain, which ultimately disserves the patients who could benefit from telehealth services. The changes that we will vote on will promote transparency and predictability for health care providers and service providers alike and will help ensure that rural patients continue to receive the care they need. I know I focused on sequels earlier, but our August meeting has already included previews. On Monday, I kicked off the week by announcing that the Commission is moving forward with new rules banning malicious caller ID spoofing of text messages and international phone calls. Using new authority given to us by Congress last year, we‚Äôll close this loophole and make it harder for international scam artists to deceive U.S. consumers and evade law enforcement. A bipartisan group of more than 40 state attorneys general have urged us to take this step as part of our multi-pronged approach to combatting spoofed robocalls. This is the latest step we‚Äôll take in addressing our top consumer protection priority. On Tuesday, I delivered remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, where I rolled out a draft order that would make it easier and cheaper to license small satellites. The proposed new regulatory process would enable small satellite applicants to choose a streamlined alternative to existing licensing procedures. We‚Äôre talking about an easier application process, a lower application fee, and a shorter timeline for review. In addition, it would offer potential radiofrequency interference protection for critical communication links, reduce the risk of orbital debris, and promote efficient use of spectrum. This will encourage growing innovation in space technologies and ensure that America continues to be the best place in the world to license and launch new satellites. And that same day, I issued a statement announcing that the Commission is moving forward with rules to make it easier to reach 911 from hotels, office buildings, and other places that use so-called multi-line telephone systems. This package will implement Congressional mandates from the Kari‚Äôs Law Act of 2017 and RAY BAUM‚ÄôS Act of 2018. Our reforms would allow hotel guests and others to call 911 directly without using a prefix, and also would establish dispatchable location requirements (like a specific address or suite number) so that first responders can reach people in need. Rounding out our August agenda are three more items. The first is a vote to adopt procedures for the auction of more than 17,000 toll-free numbers using the 833 prefix. This first-of-its-kind auction will be conducted in December. It‚Äôll serve as an experiment in using competitive bidding as a way to assign toll-free numbers equitably and efficiently. The second would update our technical rules for Low-Power FM (LPFM) stations. When the Commission launched the LPFM service in 2000, it designed the LPFM engineering requirements to be simple. The purpose was to make it easier for non-profit organizations with limited engineering expertise and small budgets to readily apply for, construct, and operate community-oriented stations serving highly localized areas. There are now over 2,100 LPFM stations, and LPFM organizations suggest that the service has matured and requires additional engineering options to improve reception. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proposing reforms such as allowing expanded LPFM use of directional antennas and permitting LPFM use of FM booster stations. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes additional changes to increase flexibility while maintaining interference protection and the core LPFM values of diversity and localism. The third focuses on how local franchising authorities may regulate cable operators. This Report and Order would faithfully implement the requirements of the Communications Act. It would prevent local authorities from unlawfully evading the five percent statutory cap on franchise fees. And it would also make clear that the Act does not allow franchising authorities to regulate most non-cable services offered by cable operators over their cable systems. Excessive fees and inappropriate regulations imposed by local governments deter broadband deployment and discourage investment in next-generation facilities and services. In short, we will be voting at the August meeting on common-sense rules that will enforce the legal framework Congress adopted decades ago and will help expedite the construction of next-generation networks. Like a modern multi-screen cineplex, the FCC‚Äôs August meeting features so many varied offerings it can be hard to keep track. You‚Äôve got multiple items to close the digital divide, new rules to curtail unwanted robocalls, a public safety proposal, an item to unleash satellite communications, updates to our radio and cable regulations, and rules for the first-ever auction of toll-free numbers. I hope every one of these offerings will be a big hit.

30	A Giant Leap For 5G	Ajit Pai	2019-06-18 14:35:00	1560893700.0	Almost 50 years ago, on July 20, 1969, people around the world watched with fascination as the United States became the first country to land a manned spacecraft on the Moon and Neil Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the lunar surface. It was an amazing sight: A man-made machine had ‚Äúslipped the surly bonds of Earth‚Äù and had successfully carried humans to another celestial object. Even today, the video gives me chills. At the FCC, we draw inspiration from the ambitious vision and persistent effort that led to this historic moment. Our primary focus may not be on moonshots (although we have been doing a lot of work to promote innovation in space), but we do share the same enthusiasm for American leadership in cutting-edge technologies. One area where we‚Äôve been doing a lot of work involves 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity. Last year, I announced a comprehensive strategy for promoting U.S. leadership in 5G‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa strategy for ‚ÄúFacilitating America‚Äôs Superiority in 5G Technology,‚Äù or the 5G FAST plan. This plan calls for freeing up spectrum, making it easier to install wireless infrastructure like ‚Äúsmall cells,‚Äù and modernizing our regulations to encourage the deployment of fiber, which is necessary for carrying wireless traffic. We‚Äôve been successfully executing each part of this plan. In fact, just last week, we got some encouraging data on the infrastructure side of the equation. New figures show that investment in our nation‚Äôs broadband networks rose in 2018 for a second straight year, with an estimated increase of $3 billion. A previous study found that fiber was deployed to more new American homes in 2018 than any year in history. And small cell deployment more than quadrupled. This is concrete evidence that our efforts to cut the red tape that holds back infrastructure deployment are getting results for American consumers. And we‚Äôre not done. The FCC‚Äôs next monthly meeting will take place on July 10. At that meeting, we will aim to take some important steps forward on the spectrum side of our 5G FAST plan. Mid-band spectrum, which offers an important combination of 5G coverage and capacity, is central to our strategy. That‚Äôs why today, I‚Äôm circulating an order to open up the 2.5 GHz band for 5G. This is the single largest band of contiguous spectrum below 3 GHz. But much of this public resource has been unused for decades. That‚Äôs partly because the technology that policymakers conceived many years ago for this band hasn‚Äôt materialized as some thought, and partly because arcane rules hampered providers from putting the spectrum to its highest-valued use. At long last, we‚Äôre going to put more of this critical mid-band spectrum to work for the American people. On July 10, the Commission will vote on an order that will modernize an outdated regulatory regime for the 2.5 GHz band, a regime developed in the days when educational TV was the only use envisioned for this spectrum. The new framework will not only give incumbent users more flexibility in how they use the spectrum, but also provide opportunities for Tribal Nations and others to obtain access to unused 2.5 GHz spectrum. Making this valuable mid-band spectrum available for new mobile services will allow for more efficient and effective use of these airwaves and will advance U.S. leadership in 5G. My colleagues have expressed a strong interest in bringing mid-band spectrum to market, and this order represents a prime opportunity to do just that. Consistent with our longstanding walking-and-chewing-gum approach, we‚Äôll also focus on unleashing high-band spectrum for 5G at our July meeting. Two months ago, I joined the President at the White House to announce that the Commission will hold an auction of the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands on December 10, 2019. This auction will be the largest in American history, releasing 3,400 megahertz of spectrum into the commercial marketplace. On July 10, the Commission will vote to finalize the procedures, terms, and conditions for this auction. Among the many key details outlined in this Public Notice, this will be an incentive auction. In addition, each of the bands available will be licensed on an unpaired basis in 100-megahertz channel blocks, and the winning bidder may provide any services permitted under a fixed or mobile allocation. While 5G is certainly getting the most buzz in telecom circles these days, closing the digital divide‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämaking sure all Americans can access high-speed Internet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääremains my number one priority. In June 2017, the FCC began to explore the unique challenges to deploying broadband to apartment, condominium, and office buildings‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat the FCC calls ‚Äúmultiple tenant environments,‚Äù or MTEs. Thanks to the work coming out of this review, the FCC will now consider a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Declaratory Ruling at our July meeting to enable the millions of Americans who live and work in MTEs to have greater choice when it comes to broadband. First, we would seek public input on actions we could take to accelerate the deployment of next-generation networks and services within MTEs. Second, we would clarify that we welcome state and local efforts to promote access to and competition in MTEs, so long as those efforts are consistent with federal policy. Third, we would preempt an outlier San Francisco ordinance to the extent it requires the sharing of in-use wiring in MTEs, a policy which deters broadband deployment. At our next meeting, we‚Äôll also modernize other regulations that are holding back the deployment of next-generation networks and services. We‚Äôll consider an item that will eliminate unnecessary pricing regulation of a subset of lower-speed ‚Äúbusiness data services‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämiddle-mile services known as ‚Äútransport‚Äù services‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoffered by price-cap incumbent carriers. The increasingly competitive marketplace for transport obviates the need for these rules‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the market distortions and stifled investment that come with them. (This is a follow-up from a decision last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that repeatedly upheld the FCC‚Äôs light-touch policy judgments in this area as reasonable.) The item will also give price cap carriers partial forbearance relief after a reasonable transition period from decades-old requirements that they provide legacy transport‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääknown as ‚ÄúDS1 and DS3 transport‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto their competitors on an unbundled basis at regulated rates. Importantly, we will grant this relief only where there is actual or potential competition that ensures reasonable prices. Removing these unnecessary regulatory burdens will spur more facilities-based competition and network deployment. Speaking of closing the digital divide, broadband connectivity is the key to a wide range of telehealth and telemedicine services. That‚Äôs why I asked Commissioner Carr last year to lead the FCC‚Äôs effort on exploring ways that the Commission could promote connected care everywhere. And I‚Äôm pleased to report that in July, we will be taking the next step in our ongoing proceeding to create a Connected Care Pilot Program within the Universal Service Fund. I‚Äôll let him flesh out the details of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, but I can say this is a significant step forward in meeting our goal of ensuring that American families and veterans can access next-generation telehealth services outside brick-and-mortar healthcare facilities. The Commission‚Äôs July meeting will also feature three media-related items. The headliner out of this trio will be an update to the FCC‚Äôs children‚Äôs television programming rules. In recent decades, we‚Äôve seen a monumental shift in the way young viewers access video programming. I‚Äôve seen it myself in comparing my own television viewing habits as a child to those of my kids today. So this update of our rules is long overdue. Commissioner Mike O‚ÄôRielly has taken the lead on this project, so I‚Äôll let him discuss how the FCC is going to modernize these regulations. The children‚Äôs television item is another aspect of the Commission‚Äôs Modernization of Media Regulations Initiative (MMRI), which is focused on updating our rules to match the realities of the media marketplace. And it‚Äôs not the only MMRI item on our July agenda. The Commission will also vote on two items that will replace wasteful and costly paper notifications with electronic notifications. The first is an order updating the triennial must-carry/retransmission consent election process for broadcasters and covered video providers, such as cable operators and satellite TV providers. Under these new rules, commercial broadcasters would no longer be required to send their elections via certified mail to each provider, but instead would upload their elections into their public files every three years and notify video providers by e-mail of any change. Moreover, cable and satellite TV providers are required to notify local broadcast television stations when they take certain actions that would affect broadcasters. For example, cable providers must provide notice if they commence service in a market or delete or reposition a broadcast station, and satellite providers must give notice prior to retransmitting certain stations or launching new services into a market. FCC rules currently require that these notices be provided to television stations by paper delivery, such as mail, certified mail, or hand delivery. Consistent with our changes we are making to the must carry/retransmission consent election process, I‚Äôm proposing that we require these notices to be transmitted by e-mail as well. These two MMRI items are just common-sense measures to update our rules for the digital age. Half a century ago, Neil Armstrong famously observed, after taking a step onto the Moon, that it was ‚Äúone small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.‚Äù For our July meeting, our goal is to take giant leaps here on the ground, from closing the digital divide to advancing U.S. leadership in 5G to helping Americans get healthier to modernizing outdated regulations. As momentous as 1969? Perhaps not. But these are moonshots in our world, and we‚Äôre excited to see where these rockets take us.

31	Beating Back Unwanted Robocalls	Babette Boliek	2019-06-05 14:35:00	1559770500.0	In the three minutes it takes to read this page, American consumers will receive about 350,000 unwanted calls to their homes, businesses, and mobile phones. Of those 350,000 unwanted calls, an estimated 47%, or 164,500 calls, are illegal‚Äîscams aimed at tricking the hurried, the trusting, and the vulnerable consumer. Each year the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC) receives hundreds of thousands of complaints from consumers about the unrelenting and constant bombardment of unwanted robocalls.  Although the FCC has taken aggressive enforcement action against illegal callers, enforcement occurs only after consumers receive the calls they so detest. Consequently, tomorrow, the FCC will consider taking immediate and future steps to permit the blocking of illegal or unwanted calls before they reach consumers‚Äô phones. You may wonder, ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt the Do Not Call Registry supposed to take care of this?‚Äù  The FCC hears you!  The Do Not Call Registry is good at reducing the number of legal calls that people get from marketing firms.  Law-abiding firms are scrupulous about ensuring they have consumer consent and check the do-not-call list before contacting people.  But most robocalls today are not from law-abiding firms.  They are illegal.  Since they have little concern for the law, they have no interest in checking the do-not-call list before placing a call. On June 6, the FCC is going to vote to clarify that under the existing rules your phone company can step in to block unwanted calls. Soon your phone company will know with certainty that it is able to block calls based on computer analytics that tells them that these calls are unwanted robocalls. Your phone company may already offer you such a service today on an opt-in basis. However, many people are not aware these services are available or do not know how to turn them on. Of course, you can opt out of your phone company‚Äôs blocking service at any time. It‚Äôs economics:  Illegal robocalls are not just a drain on individual households‚Äô peace of mind, they are also a drain on our economy.  According to the most recent data compiled by YouMail, there were about 2.5 billion illegal robocalls in March 2019 alone.  The FCC estimates the cost of these calls to consumers is at least $3 billion per year from lost time alone, not including monetary losses to fraud.  Moreover, phone companies also benefit from this decision because the cost of handling service calls by consumers can be more than $10 per call.  Thus, avoiding robocall-related customer service calls will save phone companies millions of dollars per year, far exceeding the cost of providing call blocking services. This, in fact, is one of the reasons most carrier-provided opt-in call blocking services offered today are free to the consumer. Opt-out vs. Opt-in:  Inertia is an obstacle for many consumers who otherwise would take part in a call-blocking program.  Moreover, smaller service providers have told us that convincing consumers to affirmatively sign up for a call-blocking program, rather than offering it as the default, can be costly and ineffective.  As Consumers Union explains, ‚Äúso few consumers opt-in to robocall blocking tools, yet continually express their frustration with the unending barrage of nuisance calls.‚Äù  Hiya observes that 95% of its customers choose to remain on its opt-out call-blocking program while only 20% choose to join its opt-in call blocking program.  Setting a call-blocking service as the default can significantly increase consumer participation while keeping consumer choice.  Finally, when phone companies block unwanted calls, robocall campaigns will be much less economical to inflict on the consumer. For those who have taken the time to let us know that unwanted calls bother you, the FCC thanks you.  The volume of the consumer complaints the FCC has received ‚Äì well over 200,000 per year ‚Äì says it all.   Based on these numbers, the FCC believes that most consumers would prefer to have blocking in place ‚Äì that is why you will not have to take any action for this decision to benefit you. The FCC‚Äôs vote will have a big impact and is a step in the right direction to restore the telephone as a trusted device for connecting people.

32	Ex Uno Plures: The Origin Story of the Agency General Counsel	Thomas M. Johnson Jr.	2019-05-23 11:45:00	1558637100.0	"Welcome back, dear reader, to the General Counsel's blog. If you're joining us for the first time, I'd invite you to start by reading our first post. It's a meta, long-form disclaimer about blog posts generally‚Äîa post on the Law of Blog Posts. I'd also invite you to read or watch my recent remarks to the Media Institute on Regulatory Humility: the FCC's Essential Virtue, in which I explain how the FCC under Chairman Pai is adapting old regulations to account for today's dynamic, rapidly-evolving media landscape. Speaking of new media‚Äîif you're like me, you might be suffering from withdrawal as a number of long-time, epic franchises have recently drawn to a close. Perhaps you wish you could snap your fingers and return to the start of the Avengers series or warg your way back to the first episode of Game of Thrones. If this describes you, you've come to the right place. I plan to use this space next for a series of posts on a legendary character whose story the poets, playwrights, and producers have mostly neglected to tell‚Äîthe agency general counsel. This story has all the makings of a blockbuster: It features political intrigue, warring fiefdoms, and magical powers whose sources and limits are sometimes shrouded in mystery (well, at least that's how I think of independent litigating authority). Like all good epics, this one needs an Origin Story. And that's the focus of this first post in our series. The Age of Meet, Learned Attorneys Our story starts in 1789, when a young nation's First Congress created the ""Great Departments"" of State, War, and Treasury. Things were off to a promising start, with one small problem: Congress made no provision for these departments to have their own ""in-house"" lawyers. Instead, in the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress provided that there ""shall . . . be appointed a meet person, learned in the law, to act as attorney-general for the United States,"" who was responsible both for Supreme Court litigation and to ""give his advice and opinions upon questions of law"" when requested by the President or the heads of departments. While this foundational Act suggested an ideal of unified representation of the Executive Branch, it also planted the seeds of future disunion. The Act required appointment of district attorneys (also ""meet"" and ""learned in the law"") to prosecute crimes and litigate civil actions on behalf of the United States, with no mechanism for oversight or coordination with the Attorney General. As a result, the quality and consistency of federal representation in the early years of the Republic suffered. Responding to this problem, Andrew Jackson proposed the creation of a law department to bring the district attorneys under the Attorney General's control. But Daniel Webster opposed any proposal that would add such prosaic managerial duties to the Attorney General's plate, making him ""a half accountant, a half lawyer, a half clerk, in half everything and not much of anything."" Instead, Webster proposed creating a Solicitor of the Treasurer to oversee the district attorneys. In 1830, Webster prevailed, thus cementing divided representation in the Executive Branch. Reading the Whirlwind Once Treasury had its own counsel, other departments demanded equal treatment. Congress added law posts to the Internal Revenue and War Departments, Navy, and Post Office. There things stood until the Civil War occasioned an explosion of litigation involving the United States. The district attorneys lacked the manpower to handle all the suits, and as a result, departments frequently hired their own private outside counsel. This increased both the federal government's costs and the risk of inconsistency of executive representation. ""[S]o great is the confusion and conflict,"" said Rep. Thomas A. Jenckes of Rhode Island, ""that we might as well attempt to read the whirlwind."" One unavoidable consequence of divided representation was that the government was occasionally on both sides of a dispute. In The Gray Jacket case, decided in 1866, the Secretary of Treasury and Attorney General took differing positions on whether the United States properly claimed title to a vessel seized during the Civil War.1 The Attorney General argued that the vessel was a spoil of war, seized from an Alabaman attempting to run a Union blockade; the Secretary of Treasury had been convinced by the vessel's owner that he was loyal to the United States, and was merely attempting to flee to non-rebel territory.2 Uninterested in refereeing the government's internecine disputes, the Supreme Court held that when ""the United States is a party"" and is represented by the Attorney General, ""no counsel can be heard in opposition on behalf of any other of the departments of the government."" (As we will see in a future post, this resolution has not always stood the test of time.) To settle these issues, Rep. Jenckes proposed the creation of a Department of Justice, which finally came into being on July 1, 1870. In theory, this move consolidated the advocacy and advice functions within a single executive branch. The various solicitors and district attorneys were moved to the new Department and the retention of outside counsel was prohibited. But Congress, seemingly ambivalent about the new Department, did not give it office space or repeal the statutes creating department-specific solicitors. As a result, the Attorney General could not appoint government lawyers or house them in the same location as his staff. Inertia set in and the planned centralization of executive branch attorneys never occurred. The nation's legal system remained in this largely decentralized state until the strains of another war‚ÄîWorld War I‚Äîspurred a new effort to unify the government's legal representation. World War I led to a proliferation of governmental agencies and bureaus, each with their own lawyers and litigating authority. To tame this wild growth, President Woodrow Wilson invoked his emergency war powers in an executive order that brought all law officers of the government, as well as any litigation in which the United States was a party, under the supervision and control of the Department of Justice. This solution was short-lived. World War I ended only a few months after President Wilson signed the order. The end of the war meant the end of the President's emergency war powers. When the authority underlying the order lapsed, the pendulum again swung toward decentralization. With the executive order gone, departmental lawyers threw off the yoke of the Department of Justice and again asserted their right to control litigation affecting their agencies and bureaus. At the same time, the number of departmental lawyers continued to grow: by the late 1920s, there were more than 900 legal positions in the federal government, most of them outside the Justice Department. Felix's Happy Hot Dogs Then came the New Deal. Roosevelt's ambitious federal response to the Depression resulted in the creation of scores of new federal agencies (the so-called ""Alphabet Agencies""). FDR's former advisor Ray Moley quipped that this motley assortment of new agencies resembled ""the accumulation of stuffed snakes, baseball pictures, school flags, old tennis shoes, carpenter's tools, geometry books and chemistry sets in a boy's bedroom."" Each agency in this m√©lange required legal representation. The executive departments deepened their benches of legal talent as well. In the 1930s, Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior and prominent member of President Roosevelt's cabinet, became a vocal critic of Justice handling cases involving his department. Ickes believed that he supervised ""an exceedingly able legal staff that I would not trade man for man with members of the Attorney General's staff."" He blamed Justice for a loss in an oil case and bristled at the idea of the Attorney General supervising his department's issuance of regulations. Ickes's department was not the only one that could boast an ""able legal staff."" Legions of young lawyers came to the Roosevelt administration from the nation's top law schools. Many were recruited by Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard Law professor and trusted advisor to President Roosevelt. When Frankfurter was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1939, Time magazine counted 125 ""happy hot dogs"" who owed their jobs in Washington, D.C. to their mentor, Frankfurter. These lawyers‚Äîsome of the best and brightest young legal minds of the time‚Äîflocked to Washington to staff Roosevelt's New Deal agencies. While Roosevelt made no effort to consolidate all these attorneys into the Justice Department, he did issue an Executive Order that purported to centralize litigation authority within the Department (except when otherwise provided by statute). Congress later codified this Executive Order. While these actions consolidated litigation authority within the Department of Justice, both the Executive Order and statute were silent with respect to the counseling function of departmental lawyers. This silence‚Äîcombined with the fact that administrative law was increasing in scope and complexity, and therefore increasingly required specialization‚Äîsolidified the decentralized consultative and advisory functions of internal agency counsel. The FCC, Louis, and Me It was in this environment that the FCC‚Äîand its Office of General Counsel‚Äîwas born. The FCC traces its origins to 1927, when Congress created the Federal Radio Commission with the Radio Act of 1927. The FRC shared some similarities to the modern FCC‚Äîit was headed by five commissioners, no more than three of which could be from the same political party. Its task was to allocate radio licenses at the public's convenience, interest, or necessity‚Äîa task originally expected to take only a year. The first General Counsel of the FRC was Louis Goldsborough Caldwell. Not among Frankfurter's happy hot dogs, Caldwell was nonetheless distinguished in his own right. He was a native of Chicago and graduated from Northwestern University Law School. Caldwell taught as a professor at Northwestern for a single semester, before leaving the professorship to serve with great distinction in the first World War. Following the war, Caldwell returned to Chicago to take a position at the firm that later became Kirkland & Ellis, where he worked for radio station and media clients. In June 1928, Caldwell left Kirkland to serve as General Counsel of the FRC. The rest is history. In 1934, the Communications Act transferred the FRC's jurisdiction over radio and the Interstate Commerce Commission's jurisdiction over telephone and telegraphy to the newly created Federal Communications Commission. Since then, a number of ""meet and learned"" attorneys have served as general counsel of the FCC. Among my favorites is Telford Taylor, appointed as General Counsel in 1940, who is best remembered for his later role as Counsel for the Prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials. * * * With that, we conclude our Origin Story. Fast forward to today, and you will find nearly 40,000 attorneys nested throughout the federal government,3 with only 11,000 of those in the Department of Justice.4 These attorneys together constitute the ""laterarchy"" or ""jurocracy,"" in the words of academic Donald L. Horowitz‚Äîthe complex, interconnected web of attorneys that represent the federal government today. The primary job of these attorneys is to provide legal advice to agency heads and their staff. While these lawyers often represent agencies in administrative adjudications, most do not litigate (although they typically work closely with the Department of Justice, which generally represents executive agencies in Court.) This separation of functions‚Äîthe product of a 150-year power struggle‚Äîis today so well settled that it is largely taken for granted by government lawyers. The FCC differs from some other agencies in one key respect: it has its own litigation authority. Lawyers in the FCC's Office of General Counsel, for example, defend the FCC's orders when the legality of those orders are challenged under the Hobbs Act. My office has an excellent relationship with the talented attorneys in the Department of Justice‚Äîin particular, the Office of Solicitor General and the Antitrust Division‚Äîand we work together cooperatively and collegially on a host of different matters. But in the past, the Commission's independence has meant that the FCC and DOJ have occasionally found themselves on different sides of the same case. In our next post, we'll explore ways in which conflicts among executive-branch lawyers have played out in practice, focusing on some historical examples involving the FCC. The hero of our story, the government lawyer, will be tested. But I promise that this narrative arc will add complexity to the character and make our hero stronger by the end.

33	Attention Broadcasters: Best Practices for Broadcaster Reliability and Security	Lisa M. Fowlkes	2019-05-20 09:30:00	1558369800.0	The approach of hurricane season is a reminder of the vital public safety role that local broadcasters play during emergencies.  Broadcasters are the backbone of the Emergency Alert System and often the first source of detailed news about severe weather, missing children, and other dangerous situations.  In addition, some small and minority-owned broadcasters are a primary source of information for non-English speakers in their communities. When disaster strikes, the public relies upon their local TV and radio stations to stay informed, find resources, and keep safe.  To continue fulfilling this important mission, broadcasters must ensure that their systems are secure and reliable.  Here are some best practices to help. Emergency Alert System Broadcasters have now participated in four nationwide tests of the Emergency Alert System, which has led to system improvements, but it is also important that you act to safeguard your EAS equipment.  Some resources: Recommended best practices from the FCC‚Äôs Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) for securing EAS equipment FEMA‚Äôs guide containing best practices for EAS operations and maintenance Cybersecurity Overall Broadcasters should also establish security risk management policies and practices to safeguard their operations more generally. I encourage you to review the following best practices and implement those that are applicable and most effective for your architecture:   Cybersecurity resources for small business from the FCC CSRIC best practices that focus on the core elements of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, including this guidance specific to broadcasters The Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community Voluntary Program (C3), which provides information to assist businesses in securing their networks NIST‚Äôs cybersecurity resource page for small businesses The National Association of Broadcasters‚Äô list of cybersecurity resources for broadcasters. Other organizations with useful information on this topic include the Society of Broadcast Engineers, World Broadcasting Unions, and perhaps also your state broadcast association.  In addition, the FCC will host a webinar on network reliability and security for small and rural communications providers on June 17, which I hope you will join.  The broadcast industry performs a unique and critical role as public safety informers.  With that role comes a responsibility to ensure that broadcast systems are reliable.  This responsibility must be shared at all levels‚Äîthat is, not only by the station engineer and IT department but also by the station manager, owner, and other executives. It is a challenge that needs to be embraced by broadcasters of all sizes and also by the manufacturers that supply EAS and other broadcast equipment. Let‚Äôs keep at it!     -#-	{0: {'username': 'Rose Edwards', 'date_epoch': 1569920280.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-10-01 01:58:00', 'response_content': 'Thank you so much for this helpful article - Newcastle Party Bus Hire'}, 1: {'username': 'Saasha', 'date_epoch': 1566551520.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-08-23 02:12:00', 'response_content': 'Thank you so much for this article. https://www.login-helps.com...'}, 2: {'username': 'Saasha', 'date_epoch': 1565689920.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-08-13 02:52:00', 'response_content': 'Yeah, this article looks cool and it gives much more information as well.

34	Blocking and Tackling Robocalls	Ajit Pai	2019-05-15 15:50:00	1557960600.0	‚Äú[R]obocalls ‚Ä¶ have become a become a major nuisance to the point where I don‚Äôt answer any calls unless I know the number‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand [I] have missed some very important calls ‚Ä¶ because of that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI receive so many robocalls that I don‚Äôt answer the phone unless I recognize the number.‚Äù ‚ÄúI now find that my cell phone is becoming useless as a telephone.‚Äù This is just a sample of the roughly 630 complaints that the FCC receives about unwanted robocalls each day. Like me, the American people are fed up with this flood of annoying calls. So on June 6, at our monthly meeting, the FCC will vote on giving them some much-needed relief. Combatting the scourge of unwanted robocalls has topped my consumer protection agenda since I became FCC Chairman. And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve taken many steps to fight these calls. We‚Äôve authorized carriers to block robocalls from certain spoofed numbers. We‚Äôve authorized the creation of a reassigned numbers database. We‚Äôve taken aggressive enforcement action against those who unleash robocalls on consumers. We‚Äôve demanded that phone carriers establish a robust call-authentication framework by the end of this year. And we have been working with Congress on much-needed, bipartisan anti-robocall legislation, like the TRACED Act and the STOP Robocalls Act. But this isn‚Äôt an easy problem to solve, and we always need to be thinking about what more we can do. For example, call-blocking services use analytics to identify and filter out unwanted calls. They can be a powerful weapon in the fight against robocalls, just as email providers routinely filter junk messages into your spam folder. But call-blocking services aren‚Äôt very common because they‚Äôre only offered on an opt-in basis. In other words, consumers have to actively reach out to their voice service provider to have blocking activated. Few do, and the tide of robocalls keeps coming in. Thankfully, the FCC can change this. So at our June meeting, we‚Äôll vote on a declaratory ruling that would allow phone companies to implement strong call-blocking services as the default setting for their customers. Basically, instead of being offered call blocking on an opt-in basis, carriers could provide block calls unless you affirmatively opt-out. This could mean a major reduction in robocalls, as call blocking would become the rule, not the exception. This ruling would also make clear that phone companies can allow consumers to use their own contacts as a ‚Äúwhite list.‚Äù That means your phone is only going to ring if the call is coming from somebody in your list of contacts. The item also proposes a safe harbor for carriers that block phone calls that aren‚Äôt properly authenticated once the call authentication system (called SHAKEN/STIR) is up and running. Today, I‚Äôm also sharing with my colleagues a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking designed to improve aviation safety. The Aviation Radio Service uses dedicated spectrum to enhance the safety of aircraft in flight, facilitate the efficient movement of aircraft both in the air and on the ground, and otherwise ensure the reliability and effectiveness of aviation communications. Unfortunately, the FCC‚Äôs rules for managing these airwaves haven‚Äôt kept pace with recent technological advances. That‚Äôs why at our June meeting, we‚Äôll vote on several proposals that would enable the use of today‚Äôs state-of-the-art safety-enhancing technologies. For example, I‚Äôm proposing that we allocate spectrum for Enhanced Flight Vision Systems, which use an advanced radar technology to improved pilots‚Äô ability to detect potentially dangerous objects in fog and other difficult visual environments. Rounding out our June agenda will be an update to our ‚Äúleased access‚Äù rules. These regulations require cable operators to set aside channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated video programmers. The glaring problem with our leased access rules is that they‚Äôve been in legal limbo for over a decade and haven‚Äôt been updated to account for the transformation of the video marketplace. Programmers now have a wide range of options for distributing their content, including a plethora of online platforms, so the need for burdensome leased access rules has dramatically diminished. I‚Äôve therefore provided my colleagues with an order that would modernize our regulations to better reflect today‚Äôs video marketplace. For example, it would eliminate the requirement that cable operators make leased access available on a part-time basis since there are plenty of other avenues for content creators to make available short-form programming. We‚Äôve certainly had monthly meetings with more items on the agenda, but with a major item to crack down on unwanted robocalls, this could be one of our most impactful meetings of the year.

35	Substantive Objections to a Government 5G Wholesale Network	Michael O'Rielly	2019-05-07 13:40:00	1557261600.0	"Over the last few months, various ideas have been floated about the offering of 5G wireless services via a government-sponsored network. This entire effort seems convoluted and borders on the preposterous. Just the notion of the U.S. moving away from the highly-successful, private-sector led approach that is responsible for our country's premier position globally would be a serious misstep. In essence, it would throw a monkey wrench into one of the greatest success stories in the history of technology. At the same time, it has been nearly impossible to nail down with any granularity what exactly is being contemplated by this new ""network."" To call this effort a trial balloon is insulting to balloons, as all the ideas mentioned have far less consistency than balloons, and more closely resemble a child's bubbles. Based on what we do know, however, the entire effort is jam-packed with insurmountable problems. Accordingly, I've attempted to expose a few of the issues that someone trying to create a government-sponsored 5G network would face ‚Äì no matter how it was structured ‚Äì and explain why it doesn't make logical sense. Perhaps all the rhetoric and lobbying in favor of this scheme will end once people examine some straight facts and salient arguments. No Available Spectrum Bands In an ever-increasingly wireless world, each megahertz is being strenuously fought over. Any effort to repurpose a commercial band to new and different uses, such as this proposed network, will not occur without a huge fight (consider, e.g., C-Band discussions). Moreover, the ""easy"" bands to convert for advanced wireless services have already been allocated. With that avenue essentially closed, the concept being bandied about is that this new network would be ""given"" spectrum from the Department of Defense's (DoD) holdings. The most likely DoD frequencies that could be used for this purpose would be in the 3 GHz band, but DoD has already thrown up multiple roadblocks to any commercial activity in these bands as a threat to its mission. I know this well, as I've been advocating for a complete reallocation of the 3.45 to 3.55 GHz and portions of the 3.1 to 3.45 GHz bands for commercial use. Without spectrum, there is zero chance that such a network could even function, much less succeed. Not to mention, true 5G will require low-, mid- and high-band spectrum, so it is unlikely that this nationwide network would ever be able to realize the capacity, speeds, and latency of 5G. Even if there were some magical band that DoD would make available, federal government agency spectrum cannot be used to offer commercial services. Therefore, the minute a commercial entity tried to use the government-sponsored wholesale network to offer services, the network and any users ‚Äì not to mention the DoD ‚Äì would be in violation of the law and numerous FCC rules. Good luck trying to get a private company to commit to use this wholesale network when it would be immediately subject to cease and desist orders and potential penalties from the Commission, especially since the Chairman and all Commissioners have loudly objected to this wholesale network concept from the outset. And, that is even if we get to this point, because multiple lawsuits would be filed that would bring these plans to a halt immediately. Additionally, there seems to be a very low likelihood that Congress will change the underlying laws and regulations, as relevant legislative efforts in play (e.g., bills by Senators Cruz and Cornyn) seem to be taking the discussion in the direct opposite direction. Can't Compel Usage Absent interpreting current law or regulations in an incomprehensible way, there is no way to require any provider to use a wholesale wireless network. Without a mandate, it means that any use will have to be completely voluntary. Given nationwide providers' alternative plans to roll-out 5G services and their objections to this network, they clearly have zero interest in using it. And, these are the reactions before we even have clear guidance on how access to this wholesale network would be determined. Without the bigger providers' participation, use and financial support for this new system would be left to regional providers, smaller entities, and/or new entrants. It is possible that some of these might be willing to use such a network, but their traffic load is likely to be incredibly low and wouldn't make the overall economics work. Moreover, their usage patterns would likely peak in specific locations and not others. Yet a massive network infrastructure would have to be constructed for multiple reasons, including security (see below), notwithstanding the overall demands for its use. And, if there are new entrants who can use the capacity of and support such a network, they are also free to acquire spectrum like any other commercial entity, instead of getting a government handout. No Tower Agreements/Relationships Almost all wireless towers and antenna locations are owned or leased by companies unaffiliated with the large wireless providers. However, the existing contractual relationships and uncertainty surrounding the viability of this random wholesale network model means that it is unlikely that the current wireless infrastructure would be available for this purpose. To the extent collocation is not an option, that leaves constructing new towers and contracting for new antenna sites. This would make such a network build ‚Äì starting from the ground up ‚Äì astronomically expensive. In fact, other current spectrum holders have admittedly decided not to take this approach. It would also take a very long time, if ever, to execute these agreements and finish construction, which would increase the likelihood that any nationwide network and, more importantly the dedicated spectrum, would be underutilized if this plan was ever to be put in motion. This endeavor is not unlike plans of the recently bankrupt Alliance of American Football and its backers' efforts to build a new professional football league from the ground up; jumping to the punchline, the vision lasted all of six weeks. Won't Ensure Security One of the main reasons given for the creation of a government-sponsored wholesale network is that it is the only mechanism to secure 5G communications from interceptors and those with nefarious intentions. This line of thinking is flawed for at least two reasons. First, it assumes that private sector wireless providers don't care about security or can't ensure sufficient security, which just isn't accurate. These companies have been and continue to work hard within the standard-setting bodies to incorporate security within the various 5G standard iterations. That means the protocols adopted have and will promote extensive security efforts. More importantly, these same providers know quite well that users expect security when using their networks. Thus, they have every incentive and are pursuing the appropriate steps to ensure robust, secure communications, especially in a 5G universe. Second and equally flawed is the idea that any network, especially this wholesale one, can be completely secure. To guarantee security of the overall system, no data can be handed off to another carrier or carried by the public Internet. In other words, this network must carry all its traffic from end to end, especially in a 5G universe where computing will be diffuse and not centralized, generating unlimited exposure points. Siting wireless facilities nationwide is expensive enough but building separate fiber and backhaul systems from scratch is practically undoable. Even if this were possible, which it is not, there would be intense interest in breaking into and exploiting its communications. It effectively would be an engraved invitation for any rogue entity seeking to undermine the U.S. government's sponsorship of the network. Also, arguing that this network couldn't be broken into ignores the reality of past breaches of high priority U.S. government networks (e.g., DoD, CIA). Won't Stop China's Global Expansion For those worried about the communist Chinese government's influence and resulting harmful effects, it is nearly impossible to see how hamstringing the U.S. market with a government-sponsored network will convince other countries to take similar action. Shooting oneself in the foot rarely leads others to do the same. In fact, there is no evidence showing how and no plausible argument as to why taking such a drastic step would sever other nations' installation of Chinese equipment in their networks or curtail Chinese wireless providers from gobbling market share as they move from country to country. More problematic, there is a likelihood that the U.S.'s pursuit of such a curious path ‚Äî with its added costs, extensive buildout timelines, and suspect security improvements ‚Äî would drive other nations to increase their reliance on what has typically been cheaper-priced Chinese communications equipment, placing Chinese manufacturers and providers in a stronger position than those in the U.S. and other market-based countries. And, it is fairly conceivable that the Chinese government would counter our action with even more subsidies. Instead of curtailing China's 5G global position, it may act as a further catalyst. Government Undermining Private Sector Wireless Market The establishment of such a wholesale 5G network would unfairly and inappropriately provide a U.S. government imprimatur over those of the private sector. This is not too dissimilar to the debate decades ago over whether there should be a government-sponsored national U.S. bank. While I have little doubt that our nation's existing wireless providers could compete and succeed against this new network model, just the mere threat of giving this ""idea"" serious consideration might have negative repercussions. For instance, it might improperly increase providers' risk for customer loss, especially government agency traffic; potentially initiate review of their borrowing costs; and generate negative public perception of their network security. Creating unnecessary doubt and market uncertainty for the private sector is a serious unintended consequence of continuing to even have the debate over this network. On a larger scale, such a government stamp-of-approval combined with free DoD spectrum would send a signal that we are not fully committed to American capitalism. At this precarious moment in time and with global economic uprisings on the rise, this slice of socialism sends exactly the wrong signal to the rest of the world.   *             *             * Given all the issues identified, a major question remains: why in the world would we gamble our nation's strong wireless position for a less than half-baked, flawed idea? Certainly, it makes little sense to give it any credence or pursue it in any capacity ‚Äî at least until definitive solutions to the issues above and potentially others are presented. I won't hold my breath that any attempt will be made to provide any specifics or to answer the unanswerable.

36	Fast, Reliable, and Secure	Ajit Pai	2019-04-17 13:55:00	1555534500.0	Last week, I joined the President at the White House to discuss the FCC‚Äôs efforts to promote U.S. leadership in 5G wireless communications. ‚ÄúAmerican companies must lead the world in cellular technology,‚Äù the President declared. ‚Äú5G networks must be secure. . . . They must cover every community, and they must be deployed as soon as possible.‚Äù Last week, the FCC made progress toward the last two goals, announcing December 10 as the start date for the largest spectrum auction in our nation‚Äôs history, and revealing plans to create a new $20.4 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to extend high-speed broadband in rural America. At the Commission‚Äôs May meeting, we will take action to advance the goal of security. Promoting secure communications is a long-standing FCC priority. In fact, the second-stated mission Congress gave the Commission in the Communications Act is ‚Äúthe national defense.‚Äù One facet of our work on security involves our review of foreign companies that seek to do business in the United States. In 2011, China Mobile USA, which is ultimately owned by the Chinese government, applied to the Commission seeking to provide international telecommunications services in the United States. Consistent with agency policy, we reached out to all relevant federal agencies to see if the application raised national security, law enforcement, or related concerns. After a lengthy review of the application and consultation with the U.S. intelligence community, in 2018, the Executive Branch agencies recommended that the FCC deny China Mobile USA‚Äôs application due to substantial national security and law enforcement concerns that cannot be resolved through an agreement with the company (called ‚Äúvoluntary mitigation‚Äù). Notably, this is the first time the Executive Branch has ever recommended that the FCC deny an application due to national security concerns. Based on this recommendation and the full public record in this proceeding, I have determined that approving this application would not serve the public interest. At our May meeting, the Commission therefore will vote on an Order that would deny China Mobile USA‚Äôs application. In addition, we‚Äôll also move forward with yet another item to free up spectrum for wireless services. The President‚Äôs Fiscal Year 2020 budget‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich ‚Äúpropos[es] legislative changes . . . that pertain to the FCC‚Äù and that ‚Äúare designed to improve spectrum management and represent sound economic policy‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcalls on the Commission to ‚Äúeither auction or use fee authority to assign spectrum frequencies between 1675‚Äì1680 megahertz for flexible use by 2020, subject to sharing arrangements with Federal weather satellites.‚Äù I agree with opening this spectrum for commercial use so that‚Äôs exactly what I intend to do. So today, as the first step down that path, I‚Äôm circulating a proposal to reallocate spectrum in the 1675‚Äì1680 MHz band for shared use between incumbent federal operations and new, non-federal fixed or mobile operations. Turning to the skies, we‚Äôll also vote on whether to give the green light to new satellite services. Specifically, we‚Äôll consider Theia Holdings A, Inc.‚Äôs application to construct, launch, and operate a constellation of 112 active non-geostationary-satellite orbit satellites. In addition to supporting broadband connectivity, Theia‚Äôs satellites promise to deliver remote sensing analytics, which could enable precision agriculture, first-responder support, and other applications. Next on our May agenda will be an item that I previewed at this year‚Äôs National Association of Broadcasters Show. Thanks to the Commission‚Äôs AM Radio Revitalization Initiative, the FCC has granted AM stations 1,707 construction permits for new FM translators, and almost five hundred of these translators are already on the air. These translators are helping AM broadcasters attract more listeners and advertisers. But with this success has come an uptick in interference complaints from FM stations due to the increasing number of translators on the air. To address this problem, the FCC will vote on streamlining and expediting our current process for resolving interference complaints. Among other things, the order would establish simpler interference remediation procedures, clarify listener complaint requirements, and make it easier for translators causing interference to change channels. We‚Äôll also vote on an order to improve Video Relay Services (VRS). VRS is a vital communications tool for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The new VRS rules we hope to establish will make it easier for people who rely on American Sign Language to communicate directly with signing customer support representatives. And to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse in the VRS program, the order would strengthen our mechanisms for call validation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääessentially, making sure it‚Äôs a legitimate VRS call (and hence one properly supported by federal funds). As part of an accompanying Further Notice, among other ideas, we‚Äôll propose expanding the available pool of qualified sign-language interpreters by converting the current pilot program on at-home interpreting into a permanent one. From calls to Coase: Six decades on, the great economist‚Äôs idea that the FCC should allocate scarce resources using auctions has proven to be a success. Although the Commission has typically held auctions of spectrum, last year we voted to use this market-based tool for the allocation of toll-free numbers. Next month, we‚Äôll vote on a Public Notice to initiate the pre-bidding process for the auction of certain toll-free numbers in the 833 code. Over 17,000 numbers which have been requested by more than one applicant will be available in this first-of-its-kind auction. Rounding out our May meeting will be a proposal to fine-tune the FCC‚Äôs collection of regulatory fees. (Look, I know it may not be the most exciting work we do, but laws old and new make us do it and these fees pay most of our bills.) Fulfilling our statutory requirements, this item proposes a schedule of regulatory fees for Fiscal Year 2019 and seeks input on ways to improve our regulatory fee calculations. Well then‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen you‚Äôre talking about the minutia of FCC fee schedules, you‚Äôve come a long way from high-profile events at the White House. Just know that, on issues big and small, the Commission is committed to pursuing an aggressive agenda to modernize its rules, protect our national security, and expand digital opportunity to all Americans.

37	Caveat Lector: A Blog Post About Reliance on Agency Blog Posts	Thomas M. Johnson Jr.	2019-04-04 12:30:00	1554406200.0	I‚Äôm delighted today to reintroduce a feature that should be familiar to longtime readers of the FCC‚Äôs website‚Äîthe General Counsel‚Äôs Blog!  In this space, I hope to report on some of the important work that the Office is doing to support the FCC‚Äôs mission‚Äîincluding our critical work to promote the deployment of next-generation communications networks, reduce and eliminate unnecessary regulatory barriers, and close the digital divide. First, a word about our Office.  We currently have over seventy attorneys and staff who support our Office‚Äôs role as chief legal advisor to the Commission.  Our experienced attorneys review and advise on pending Commission meeting items and other draft orders to ensure that they are legally sustainable.  We also have our own talented, in-house litigation team that defends our orders before the federal courts of appeals when they are challenged under our judicial review statute.  (I recently had the honor of arguing a case for the first time as General Counsel in the Restoring Internet Freedom litigation before the D.C. Circuit‚Äîa marathon featuring seven oral advocates and nearly five hours of argument!)  Our legal team does a lot of other important work as well‚Äîfrom reviewing transactions pending before the Commission to overseeing fraud and bankruptcy matters to advising on employment and fiscal law to working with the Department of Justice on trial court litigation to processing Freedom of Information Act requests. Given that OGC last posted to its blog over 8 years ago, we think it is high time‚Äîand a fitting way to resurrect the General Counsel‚Äôs Blog‚Äîto begin with a post about blog posts.  Blogging:  In the Public Interest The Commission, like other agencies, has embraced the use of blogging.  It is easy to see why: Blogs offers major advantages in terms of technology, format, and accessibility.  We can post right away, and our posts can be as long or as short as necessary.  The tone is informal; blogs can translate the dense text of laws and regulations into the conversational tone of the internet.  Blogs allow us to quickly and informally remind, warn, explain, notify, update, comment on, review, and preview topics of interest to the public and those we regulate.  In many ways, blog posts are simply the digital version of the informal advice that the Commission has been providing since its formation in 1934‚Äîin telephone conversations, meetings, presentations, staff letters and other correspondence.  Like those other modes of providing informal advice, blog posts are meant only to inform and explain.  While they may refer to or discuss the Commission‚Äôs official authorities, they do not themselves carry the same force of law as those authorities.  Unlike the Commission‚Äôs regulations and orders, informal advice provided in blog posts cannot serve as a sword or a shield in litigation, nor can it supersede or alter the laws it is attempting to explain.  And that is a good thing.  As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, ‚Äúinformal communications between agencies and their regulated communities‚Äù are ‚Äúvital to the smooth operation of both government and business.‚Äù[1]  A world in which every agency utterance was binding would be a world in which informal communication could not exist.  Agency staff, forever stuck in a defensive crouch, could communicate only by formal, binding order.  Phones would ring unanswered; the Commissioners‚Äô Twitter feeds would cease to enlighten and entertain. Standing between us and this dystopia is a sensible distinction:  Official agency action is binding and authoritative, while informal staff advice is not.  And while a party may rely on authoritative agency action, those that rely on informal staff advice do so at their own risk.  What follows is an explanation of that distinction, spiced with a few cautionary tales of undue reliance on informal advice.  We also explain why blog posts typically fall into the category of informal advice (hint: it has to do with the byline). The Commission‚Äôs Informal Advice:  Helpful, But Not Authoritative The Commission has long cautioned parties about relying on the statements or informal opinions of its staff, noting that ‚Äú[a] person relying on informal advice given by Commission staff does so at their own risk.‚Äù[2]  While staff advice is helpful, it is subject to misinterpretation, to the full Commission taking a different view‚Äîand yes, to a particular staff member getting it wrong.  The FCC Record is littered with examples: An attorney advises its broadcaster client not to obtain a radio station license after staff in the Commission‚Äôs International Bureau allegedly advised him that the Commission would not be initiating enforcement actions against certain unlicensed cross-border broadcasters.[3]  A number of Local Exchange Carriers impose end-user common line charges on payphones, relying in part on two informal staff letters issued in response to formal complaints suggesting that the charges were appropriate under the Commission‚Äôs rules.[4] Based in part on alleged conversations with ‚Äúsomeone at the Commission‚Äù regarding the proper classification of their wireless data transmission service, two companies provide wireless data transmission service under licenses to provide Radiolocation Service (i.e., not under licenses to provide wireless data transmission service).[5] In each case, the informal staff advice‚Äîor at least, the regulated parties‚Äô interpretation of that advice‚Äîwas ultimately incorrect.  In each case, the regulated parties raised the Commission‚Äôs informal advice as a defense to a complaint or enforcement action.  And in each case, this informal advice provided no help to the parties when the Commission took a contrary view of their legal obligations.   Antennae Restrictions, FCC Insiders, and Videotape No case has squarely addressed whether blog posts are binding on an agency, but there is ample authority for the proposition that informal staff advice is not binding. The FCC frequently cites Malkan FM Assocs. v. FCC for this proposition.[6]  In that case, two unsuccessful applicants challenged the Commission‚Äôs dismissal of their radio station construction applications, which had proposed antenna heights that exceeded restrictions set by international agreement.[7]  Arguing that they should have been allowed to amend their applications, the unsuccessful applicants offered a videotape from a Commission-sponsored seminar, in which an FCC official suggested in a presentation that the applicants‚Äô error was among those that could be corrected at a later stage in the application process.[8]  The court rejected this argument, noting that a Commission order clearly barred the applicants from amending their application.  To the extent that ‚Äúan FCC insider, at an official seminar‚Äù said otherwise, the court held that ‚Äú[i]n the real world of agency practice, [ ] slips of this kind are not rare and should not engender reliance.‚Äù[9]  In a recent case, the Commission applied this reasoning to the blog post of a Commission official. In Nueva Esperanza, Inc. v. FCC,[10] unsuccessful applicants for a Low Power FM Radio Station, Nueva Esperanza, Inc. (‚ÄúNEI‚Äù) argued that the successful applicants had violated a Commission rule barring pre-application collaboration.  The source of this ‚Äúrule‚Äù was a blog post authored in 2012 by the then-Chief of the Commission‚Äôs Media Bureau, which offered informal advice to prospective applicants.[11]  Both the Media Bureau and the full Commission rejected this argument, noting that the blog post was ‚Äúinformal staff advice‚Äù and therefore not authoritative.[12]  NEI appealed to the D.C. Circuit, where the Commission repeated its position that ‚Äúthe blog post [was] at most informal staff advice that should not engender any reliance.‚Äù[13]  Ultimately, the D.C. Circuit never ruled on the question whether the Commission was bound by the advice provided in the blog post, because it found that, even if it were, the post itself supported the Commission‚Äôs argument.[14]  Beyond Bad Jokes and Contractions:  Why Blog Posts Are Informal Staff Advice At bottom, the question whether an agency pronouncement is authoritative (and thus should engender reliance) turns less on the medium‚Äîfor example, blog post, presentation, or letter‚Äîthan on whether the pronouncement bears the indicia of authoritative agency action.[15]  Of course, the classic example of binding authority is a legislative rule, promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking.[16]  Courts have also recognized that an agency‚Äôs other pronouncements ‚Äúcan, as a practical matter, have a binding effect.‚Äù[17]  This could be the case, for example, where an agency pronouncement expresses a substantive change in policy, contains mandatory language, and is presented as the official view of an agency.[18]  One usually must read no further than a blog post‚Äôs byline to see that it does not bind the Commission.  As the D.C. Circuit has held, ‚Äú[a]t the very least, a definitive and binding statement on behalf of the agency must come from a source with the authority to bind the agency.‚Äù[19]  Blog posts are typically written and published by individual staff members, who do not individually have the power to bind the Commission.  That is true even of the Chairman[20] or a Bureau Chief.[21] Several other aspects of blog posts confirm that they are at most informal staff advice: They are not published in the FCC Record, the official reporter for FCC documents; They do not bear any official reference number, such as the DA-xxxx number typically assigned to actions taken on delegated authority, nor do they contain any official caption or docket number[22]; They are generally written in an informal style, and, unlike Bureau orders, do not contain any ordering clauses; They typically explain what official Commission authority requires, rather than purport to announce or impose any new or independent obligations; and They are generally written by individual staffers, and the posts are not attributed to the full Commission, nor do they otherwise indicate that they represent the considered judgment of the Commission. Blog posts may not be authoritative, but that does not mean they are not helpful.  Among other things, the Commission can use blog posts to tell the public about upcoming litigation, to remind them of deadlines, and to explain or provide advice about new rules.  But parties should rely only on the Commission‚Äôs official authorities‚Äîsuch as its rules and orders.  If a party wants authoritative clarification of these authorities, there are several ways to get it, including by petitioning the Commission for a declaratory ruling.[23] **** This entire post serves as a kind of long-form disclaimer, explaining why the Commission is not bound by statements made in blog posts.  But to remove all doubt‚Äîand because ‚ÄúBetter safe than sorry!‚Äù is the lawyer‚Äôs battle cry‚ÄîI will nevertheless include the following disclaimer on my future posts: This post represents the views of the above-named attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel and is not intended to reflect the official views of the Commission.

38	A Needed USF Budgetary Cap	Michael O'Rielly	2019-04-02 15:40:00	1554244800.0	A lot of foolish policy ideas are floated in Washington, DC, so it‚Äôs fortuitous when the federal government undertakes thoughtful and sensible policy reform.  The FCC recently chose the latter and better course last week when an item was circulated to Commissioners to begin a rulemaking that would establish a much-needed and overdue budget for the agency‚Äôs Universal Service Fund (USF).  Against the backdrop of special interest groups and uninformed detractors reflexively opposed to any restraint on the agency‚Äôs redistributive subsidies, I am proud to lead this effort to inject more fiscal responsibility into the USF.  At its heart, this effort is about protecting the hardworking American consumers who bear the burden of paying regressive USF fees, and promoting and maintaining universal service in a more predictable, efficient, and responsible manner.  Hardly a revolutionary idea, budgets are precisely what American families and businesses rely on to manage their everyday operations.  On the government side, nearly every federal spending program, with the exception of entitlement programs‚Äîwhich USF is not‚Äîoperate within reasonable limitations.  From cancer research, to defense spending, to Congressional committees, and all programs in between, almost everyone operates within the confines of a budget.  Budgets force overseers to exert proper scrutiny to ensure that spending doesn‚Äôt exceed available resources or reasonable limits.  Budgets also help drive out program waste, fraud, and abuse by encouraging those running up against a cap to eliminate inefficiencies that detract from achieving the program‚Äôs mission and value.  At a minimum, budgetary restrictions generate necessary debate about overall priorities before increased spending is authorized.  Most importantly, budgets protect those responsible for paying into the system from being on the hook for every imaginable impulse purchase or expenditure.  The necessity of a budget is self-evident in the context of the Commission‚Äôs USF program.  As a redistributive subsidy mechanism funded through fees on consumers‚Äô landline and wireless phone bills, the USF features four sub-programs dedicated to bringing connectivity to different segments of America: high cost areas; low-income consumers; schools and libraries; and rural health care providers.  While I am a firm supporter of the principle of universal service, which has been inherent to the fabric of federal communications law for decades, historic evidence of inefficiencies, fraud, and duplicative spending across certain parts of the USF is alarming.  In particular, wasteful overbuilding among the constituent programs remains one of the fund‚Äôs most serious problems. Meanwhile, USF spending has steadily increased over the years, and we‚Äôve seen the ‚Äúcontribution factor‚Äù‚Äî the burden levied on consumers‚Äîwhich currently hovers around 20 percent of a contributor‚Äôs telephone bill, continually rise.  It may not be listed in the Internal Revenue Code, but, make no mistake, this fee functions like a tax on consumer phone bills.  Fundamentally, I believe we must set an upper limit of what we‚Äôre willing to take from hardworking American consumers to support these subsidies.  Determining this maximum level is also a necessary precondition to any effort to reform the FCC‚Äôs method for assessing USF contributions. Further, an overall cap is crucial even despite the existence of individual caps on three of the four USF sub-programs.  The Commission has repeatedly raised the budgets of those programs without being required to offset spending elsewhere or consider the implications for the health of the whole fund.  In contrast, an overall budget would require the Commission to more thoughtfully consider the cost-effectiveness of its spending decisions and the consequences of raising one program‚Äôs budget for the entire USF enterprise.  And, to the extent that raising the cap would be necessary in the future, the Commission wouldn‚Äôt be precluded from voting to do so.  However, the choice to increase spending would be exercised in a much more transparent and accountable manner. Not that any of this would be apparent based on the recent indignation by special interest groups opposed to any sort of budget whatsoever.  Based on some of the more hysterical accounts, a cap would only serve to undermine digital access and hurt the disadvantaged.  This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.  Consider that the item‚Äôs proposed budgetary cap of $11.42 billion is well-above current disbursement levels, leaving almost a $2 billion cushion for potential future spending.  More importantly, what critics fail to consider is that it is untrammeled USF spending that ultimately impedes digital access, not a cap on the fund.  Any increase in USF expenditures is paid for by consumers, and, since the USF fee is non-progressive, providers generally assess it equally against all their consumers.  The burden of an increased contribution fee, therefore, falls disproportionately on low-income households because they pay a greater portion of their income toward telecommunications services than high-income households.  In other words, an unchecked USF means disproportionate burdens get placed on those users most sensitive to price changes and most likely to change their spending decisions in response to higher fees.  The need to protect these consumers is also why I have always opposed attempts to subject Internet access to USF contributions: it‚Äôs a well-established principle of economics that discriminatory taxes affect consumption, and levying a tax on the Internet would make it harder for lower-income households to be able to afford the cost of getting connected.  This outcome runs totally counter to the goal of promoting digital access. While it may be easy to demagogue the introduction of further budgetary constraints on the USF, bringing universal connectivity to Americans requires a much more holistic and thoughtful approach.  Through this item, that‚Äôs exactly what we intend to pursue.

39	The Next Big Thing	Ajit Pai	2019-03-21 13:30:00	1553200200.0	"Three weeks from tomorrow, the FCC will hold its official meeting for April 2019. Now, April 12 is significant for many reasons, but the one I find most fitting at the moment is that it's country music legend Vince Gill's birthday. I like a lot of his songs, but for agency purposes, I'd say ""Next Big Thing"" reflects well much of what we'll be voting on a few weeks hence. Take the refrain that ""[e]verybody's waiting for the next big thing."" That certainly seems to be the case with 5G. 5G is indeed the next big thing in wireless; it has transformative potential, including much faster speeds, much lower latency, much more capacity, and new services and applications, many of which nobody can even predict today. We're seeking to deliver on this potential in April by gearing up for an auction of the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz spectrum bands. Before I get into the particulars, it's worth noting that this would be our third major spectrum auction to take place in 2019. Earlier this year, the FCC successfully concluded bidding on the United States' first auction of millimeter wave airwaves for 5G services, awarding nearly 3,000 licenses in the 28 GHz band. Just last week, we started the bidding in our second auction of millimeter wave spectrum, this time in the 24 GHz band. And with this public notice on auctions procedures, we take a significant step towards an auction of the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz spectrum bands later this year. The public notice makes proposals and asks questions about the essential features of this auction. For example, with respect to auction procedures, we're seeking comment on plans for a new incentive auction, in which we propose to use an ascending clock auction format for the offered licenses and then hold a sealed-bid assignment phase. We also propose offering 100 megahertz blocks of spectrum licensed by Partial Economic Area service areas. In combination, the upper 37 GHz and the 39 GHz bands would offer the largest amount of contiguous spectrum in the millimeter wave bands for flexible-use wireless services‚Äîa total of 2,400 megahertz. And the 47 GHz band, no slouch itself, will provide an additional 1,000 megahertz of millimeter wave spectrum for such services. Combined with the two preceding auctions, the Commission will be making available almost five gigahertz of spectrum for commercial use this year. On a related but separate note, I've also circulated a proposal that we'll vote on at our April meeting that would facilitate next-generation wireless services in the 37 GHz band. This proposal would finalize arrangements for the upper 37 GHz band by establishing a process for the U.S. Department of Defense to operate there on a shared basis in limited circumstances. (I want to take this opportunity to thank our counterparts at the Pentagon for their cooperation. The issues involved are quite complex, and I appreciate their working in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of them.) This proposal would also establish rules authorizing Fixed-Satellite Service operators, such as satellite broadband service operators, to license individual earth stations in the 50 GHz band. This isn't all we'll be doing on the wireless front. As the FCC's 5G FAST Plan makes clear, U.S. leadership in 5G depends not only on spectrum, but also infrastructure. Here, too, the FCC's April meeting will give us a chance to make progress. We currently have rules on the books that prohibit state and local restrictions that unreasonably impair the ability of users to deploy what are called ""over-the-air reception devices."" But these rules were developed a long time ago. They had in mind the delivery of video services, not broadband. So they don't apply to antennas operating as hub or relay antennas used to transmit signals to or receive signals from multiple customer locations‚Äîin short, the kind of equipment that could be used for innovative new wireless services. On April 12, the FCC will vote on a proposal to update these rules. We'll aim to pave the way for next-generation networking technologies that operate over millimeter waves, specifically, things like the base stations and hubs that make up mesh networks‚Äîmodern-day over-the-air reception devices, so to speak. The rest of the FCC's April meeting will feature a series of measures to modernize or eliminate outdated rules. I'd like to think we'll draw inspiration from Gill's ""Next Big Thing,"" which as you know begins ""Things have changed in the modern world. It makes it kinda crazy for a boy and girl."" Well, that goes for the Code of Federal Regulations, too, so we're poised to get rid of some kinda crazy rules. The first and foremost of these is the so-called ""rate floor."" Here's the background. In 2011, the FCC required certain rural carriers that receive federal subsidies (universal service support) to impose minimum monthly rates for telephone service. This minimum was called the rate floor. Among other problems with this so-called rate floor, it forced many rural customers to pay higher rates than some of their urban counterparts, without any corresponding federal benefit. This policy disproportionately hurts seniors and low-income households that can least afford to pay inflated bills. I've spoken for years against the rate floor, pointing out that it perversely raises rates on consumers who tend to have lower incomes. For years, we've kicked the can down the road with piecemeal delays in the rate floor. Now, if we don't take action soon, many rural Americans' rates will go up by almost 50% in July. In three weeks, we'll vote on squashing the can and ending this counterproductive regulation once and for all. A diverse coalition of organizations, ranging from AARP to the National Tribal Telecommunications Association, supports eliminating the rate floor, and I hope that the Commission will vote in April to get rid of it. This isn't the only outmoded idea we'll target. For another, imagine physically going to the offices of your local cable operator to get a current listing of the cable television channels it offers. Obviously, the very notion is ridiculous, which is why it's equally preposterous that the FCC still has rules requiring cable companies to keep such listings in such offices in hardcopy. Recognizing that this information about the channel lineups is now available through other sources, the Commission will be voting to eliminate this requirement. If approved, this would be the 12th order eliminating or updating obsolete rules and processes through the Commission's Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative. We'll also tackle several obsolete phone company regulations at our April meeting. These requirements were first established more than two decades ago‚Äîin an era when the ""Baby Bell"" companies and other incumbent carriers had monopolies in the local telephone market and were looking to enter the long-distance market. The communications marketplace has completely transformed since then, and these regulations have outlived their usefulness. So I'm circulating an order that would address portions of a petition filed by USTelecom for forbearance relief from these requirements (the Commission will resolve the rest of that petition at a later date). Specifically, the order would forbear from the burdensome rule that smaller, rural incumbent carriers offer long-distance telephone service through a separate affiliate. The order would also relieve incumbent carriers from the obligation to submit unnecessary reports about their legacy ""special access"" services and from a duplicative statutory provision regarding access to telephone poles. Without this regulatory overhang and the compliance burden that goes along with it, carriers can instead focus their resources on delivering next-generation services‚Äîin other words, the ""Next Big Thing""‚Äîto American consumers. You've read this far, for which I'm grateful. But I don't want to push it. For as ""Next Big Thing"" warned us, ""[f]or a little while, you can do no wrong; live it up, son, 'cause it don't last long."" I'm looking forward to April 12, when the FCC will keep delivering results for the American people. And maybe we'll toast Vince, too."

40	Further Improving the FCC's Procedures	Michael O'Rielly	2018-12-20 10:00:00	1545325200.0	"One fundamental obligation of a regulatory body is to constantly scrutinize its internal workings and processes. Failure to do so can undermine an entity's efficiency, openness, fairness, and credibility and compromise its ability to respond to changing market conditions. Further, governmental bodies that neglect to update their internal procedures are inclined to continually patch over problems or conduct workarounds ‚Äî i.e., applying tape to a leaky faucet, rather than fixing its main cause. This ultimately results in inconsistent and arbitrary processes and decision making. Chairman Pai has rightly recognized that process and structure do matter and has made improvements to the FCC's operations and fixed several procedural shortfalls. However, more work remains, and I am committed to seeing this effort through. Accordingly, to help take the next leap towards a more efficient, accountable, and transparent FCC, I have scoured previous proposals, spoken to interested parties, and considered my own personal experiences, and have prepared a list of ideas designed to improve the Commission's processes for our licensees, practitioners, Commissioners, and, most importantly, American consumers. It's now time to publicly release these medium, small, and tiny, mostly non-mutually exclusive ideas, and have each produce feedback on its merits or pitfalls. The following list should serve to generate debate, invite further ideas, and help move the Commission forward. Perhaps others have different or more extensive ideas, all the better!   Reform Proposals 1. Require OEA sign-off on all items, conduct extensive CBA review of all items over $100 million, and adopt item enacting OMB Circular A4 for Commission. 2. Require the applicable bureaus to establish a specific list of wireless devices that are subject to Commission's Hearing Aid Compatibility rules. 3. All initial edits to Open Meeting items should be posted by Commissioners prior to 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Conversations about any edits should commence well in advance. 4. Require final text of Open Meeting items be available to Commissioners no later than 24 hours in advance of meeting. 5. Allow Commissioners to elevate a decision or item from delegated authority to a full Commission vote pursuant to specific conditions. 6. Streamline and establish deadlines for applications undergoing Team Telecom review. 7. Publicly post Circulation Items (minus adjudications) when circulated to Commissioners; alternatively, post after 30 days. 8. Fix circulation process by establishing time limits for sitting on list and recirculation requirements. 9. Reduce Must Vote time allotment by up to 21 days or more. 10. Codify 48-hour rule for notification of Commissioners of each item to be approved under delegated authority. 11. Establish specific limits on the use of delegated authority. 12. Affirm that use of the Commission in law means the full Commission and such authority can't be delegated without affirmative vote. 13. Prohibit anyone but Commissioners from making any substantive changes between White Copy and the Open Meeting. 14. Allow Commissioners to offer amendments to items at the Open Meetings. 15. Establish mandatory sunsets for Commission rules to promote future reexamination of issues and burdens; include sunsets for any pilot projects. 16. Limit use of ""Predictive Judgments"" and regularly revisit rules adopted under such reasoning to ensure projections were accurate and still apply. 17. Impose time limit of 18 months on life of any ""Interim Rule."" 18. Prevent publication and press efforts for any Commission Enforcement Citation unless applicable party has been sufficiently notified in advance. 19. Require Enforcement Bureau to track collection process for Notices of Apparent Liability and Forfeiture Orders; establish relationship with DOJ, as necessary, to accomplish task; make data public. 20. Implement a deregulatory presumption when reviewing and implementing rules and forbearance requests. 21. Establish universal deadlines for all bureau actions. 22. Eliminate the Administrative Law Judge function. 23. Establish specific process for any hearing designation order with deadlines. 24. Establish real shot clocks and deadlines for all Commission proceedings with minimum exceptions. 25. Create an amnesty period to facilitate compliance for non-serious EB violations. 26. Put USAC contract out for public bid; allow USAC to function as private company. 27. Limit USAC recoupment for administrative errors to seven years. 28. Prioritize USAC audits & reviews of administrative errors to those instances when costs would not exceed potential recoupment. 29. Require any money recouped for fraudulent use of USF by applicants go back into USF program. 30. Reform USAC board to reduce size and eliminate conflicts of interests. 31. Outline specific bright line rules for policy calls to be made by Commission and execution decisions to be made by USAC. 32. Require that any changes to a USF form or form instructions, including online forms, must be preceded by sufficient notice of not less than 60 days. 33. Require publication of information regarding the size, accruals, and disbursements of any reserved funding for any USF program. 34. Revise rules regarding the National Exchange Carrier Association to facilitate transparency and evaluate whether the functions designated to it are being accomplished in an efficient, cost effective, and neutral manner. 35. Prevent USAC from using webcrawls or newsfeeds to inform applicants of case decisions. 36. Strike automatic USF rate increases & require Commission to affirmatively vote any increase on consumers. 37. Revise the forfeiture guidelines to update/rationalize penalties and reduce reliance on upward adjustments; reconsider and harmonize how forfeitures are calculated (e.g., by day, by call, by device); clearly establish what constitutes a continuous violation. 38. Limit bureau staff participation & direction of Commission advisory committees; ensure problem assigned to advisory committee is not tilted to a particular outcome; prevent advisory committees from attempting to assign work to Commission. 39. Prevent voluntary recommendations or best practices (from industry or advisory committees) from converting into mandates. 40. Extend terms of Chief Economist and Chief Technologist up to 2 years. 41. Upgrade spectrum auction software to permit multiple auctions simultaneous with unlimited license sizes. 42. For any guest witnesses at Open Meetings: provide advance notice to Commissioners; allow minority/other Commissioners to include witnesses; require witness testimony 48 hours in advance. 43. Extend closure of dormant proceedings to other categories (e.g., petitions for review); automatically close proceedings after set time absent Commission extension. 44. Expand use of electronic communications for licensing and notifying licensees. 45. Require all processes & record retention to be electronic, including HR and acquisition documents, Secretary's circulation & release process, & voting on personnel items; Eliminate press copy & press table paper copies. 46. Allow remote voting without VDI; improve official recordkeeping by including initial draft, final redline and final draft in eCLAS (or any successor database). 47. Require Open Meeting votes to be entered electronically. 48. Fix eBARF software so that MobileIron and FCC phones can be used & additional people can be added to the database to approve the release of an item. 49. Update the Commission's ""Commissioner's Guide to the Agenda Process"" to reflect all practices and procedures regarding Commission-level items. 50. Adopt and publish official rules of procedure at each Chairman change. 51. Eliminate paper copies of FCC Record. 52. Improve and standardize workload and backlog tracking throughout the agency; provide Commissioners reports about Bureau/Office workload and backlog. 53. Reduce cost of Fed. Reg. process by publishing links to Commission items. 54. Track Fed. Reg. process, publication and status publicly, including comment/effective dates. 55. Track PRA process, publication and status publicly, including effective dates. 56. Maintain updated webpage for all significant proceedings so description & relevant items are easily located. 57. Eliminate Reference Room and merge remaining functions with remaining ""Library"" functions. 58. Commission template for items should be updated for macro consistency with latest versions of Word. 59. Permit & expand the summary disposition of PFRs/AFRs throughout the agency (formalize the consent agenda process for all Bureaus/Offices). 60.

41	Muni Broadband‚Äôs Ominous Threat to the First Amendment	Michael O'Rielly	2018-12-13 15:00:00	1544738400.0	As a staunch supporter of limited government and free speech, I have regularly objected to government attempts to own and control the nation‚Äôs communications networks.  Historically and in many current societies throughout the world, governments have repressed the free exchange of ideas and information, often to serve the interests of domineering political leaders in undemocratic nations. Only by preserving the private sector‚Äôs preeminent role in offering communications services and diligently defending the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution can we ensure that such circumstances won‚Äôt develop in America. I have carried this mission forward ‚Äî even when doing so hasn‚Äôt been easy or universally saluted ‚Äî pursuant to my oath to defend the Constitution in each aspect of my current role. For these reasons and others, I have been a staunch critic of government projects to build and operate broadband networks.  Beyond flirting with a perverse form of socialism, municipalities‚Äô overbuilding of private providers creates market inefficiencies, distorts competitive outcomes, encourages regulatory favoritism towards state-owned networks, and can be a waste of taxpayer money.  Even in instances where municipal, or muni, broadband reaches unserved areas, it substantially deters private entities from entering a market. Moreover, as I recently discussed in a speech at the Media Institute‚Äôs annual gala in honor of free speech, certain muni broadband providers have been known to precondition access to their networks on acceptance of vague speech codes, creating an ominous threat to the First Amendment.  The relevant two paragraphs ‚Äî within an eleven-minute speech ‚Äî must have struck a nerve, as muni broadband supporters abruptly responded to my remarks with hysterical outrage.  Most comments involved vicious ad hominem attacks, and included language such as ‚Äúlying,‚Äù ‚Äústupidest,‚Äù and ‚Äúsell-out,‚Äù all undeserving of any response.  And, while I would have welcomed a substantive debate on this topic, even those more detailed critiques largely sidestepped the civil liberties issue I raised and, instead, resorted to misleading and irrelevant arguments.  Accordingly, it only seems appropriate to set the record straight on several falsehoods spread by individuals in response to my speech and expand upon the serious First Amendment threat posed by muni broadband speech codes.  Government Speech Restrictions Are Inherently Distinct from Their Private-Sector Counterparts In my speech, I focused on the terms of service of several prominent muni broadband providers that precondition access to their networks on adherence to content-based restrictions on speech.  For example, research by Professor Enrique Armijo found that Chattanooga, Tennessee‚Äôs muni broadband provider prohibits users from posting messages ‚Äúthat are excessive and/or intended to annoy or harass others‚Äù on third-party forums and blogs and has forbidden use of the network to transmit, distribute, or store ‚Äúthreatening, abusive or hateful content‚Äù or material that offends ‚Äúthe privacy, publicity, or other personal rights of others.‚Äù  Similarly, research by Theodore Bolema and Michael Horney of the Free State Foundation found that Concord Light, the muni broadband provider in Concord, Massachusetts, threatens to block content ‚Äúthat Concord Light deems to be unlawful, harmful, or offensive, or otherwise, in its reasonable discretion.‚Äù  It also prohibits transmission of content that is ‚Äúdefamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, tortious, unlawful, threatening, intimidating, or invasive of an individual‚Äôs personal privacy‚Äù and use of the network in a manner that ‚Äúdegrades, threatens, or victimizes an individual, group or class of individuals or an entity.‚Äù Critics responded by pointing out that private ISPs condition network use on practically identical terms of service, and that I was biased in singling out municipal providers.  What nonsense.  Pointing out that ‚Äúeveryone else is doing it too‚Äù is no justification for abridging the First Amendment, especially when a cursory look at the terms of service of private ISPs shows that provisions differ by provider and some are far less discretionary and restrictive than the examples I cited.  More importantly, while it may be true that certain private ISPs condition network use on acceptance of speech agreements, this fact is totally irrelevant from a constitutional perspective.  Even to this non-lawyer, First Amendment 101 teaches that the provision only applies to state actors, such as the federal government, as well as state and local governments through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.  In other words, an act of censorship may be permissible if performed by a private actor but prohibited if executed by the state.  On top of their confusion with respect to how the Constitution works, my critics also tacitly admit that ISP content-based speech codes are acceptable in certain circumstances.  However, these are by and large the same critics who have advocated for the reinstatement of burdensome public utility regulation for broadband providers and argued that, in the absence of Title II, muni broadband is necessary to ensure that all Internet content is treated equally and agnostically.  But there is nothing neutral about a user policy that threatens content-based censorship, and my critics completely undermine their position by justifying muni broadband censorship based on private providers‚Äô terms.  Perhaps their true view is that censorship is justifiable for certain types of content or viewpoints, but such a policy is inconsistent with principles of content neutrality, and they can‚Äôt have it both ways. Muni Broadband Does Not ‚ÄúPromote‚Äù First Amendment Values In what I can only describe as an attempt to enflame and confuse the debate, my critics further argued that rather than restricting online discourse, muni broadband providers promote First Amendment values and the free flow of information.  This is at best na√Øve and at worst an Orwellian sleight of hand. In the wake of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, certain groups, including the ACLU, rushed to promote muni broadband as an alternative to Title II, arguing (mistakenly) that, as long as private ISPs were not subject to public utility regulation, online expression will be subject to private censorship and that governments ought to own and operate networks to ensure that the Internet remains free and open.  This claim could not be more absurd. Beyond the fact that the threat to free speech online posed by private ISPs ‚Äî as opposed to other technological platforms ‚Äî has not been truly shown to be more than hypothetical, the government is arguably the worst-positioned entity to protect free expression on the Internet.  As has been borne out over the past several decades, the business case to engage in viewpoint or ideological discrimination does not exist for private ISPs, apart from meeting users‚Äô expectations.  Further, there is a fundamental difference between the type of censorship at issue in the case of government versus private providers.  To the extent that private ISPs have an incentive to engage in content restriction, such activity would be driven not out of an ideological or viewpoint-discriminatory motive, but for anti-competitive or commercial purposes.  And, consumers are protected from anti-competitive ISP content restriction by antitrust law and the Federal Trade Commission.  In contrast, muni broadband providers have a tremendous incentive to engage in viewpoint or ideological discrimination ‚Äî the most suspect and proscribed type of censorship, under Supreme Court precedent.  Governments worldwide are notorious for content-based online restrictions to achieve despicable goals.  According to a study by the OpenNet Initiative of 40 countries around the world, the majority had engaged in filtering or blocking of Internet content.  And, with speech codes that leave so much room for bureaucratic discretion, there is little reassurance that muni broadband speech codes wouldn‚Äôt be used discriminatorily to target content by the municipal government‚Äôs political foes.  Moreover, while competition cuts against censorship for private ISPs, such economic constraints do not apply in the case of the government.  The government lacks any economic incentive to operate efficiently or provide a better Internet experience; instead, it has an incentive to cross-subsidize its own broadband prices and crowd out private providers.  Rather than encouraging competition, the government‚Äôs entrance into the broadband market does the very opposite:  it disincentivizes private investment and new entrants and, in turn, undermines the economic forces that restrict ISP censorship.  Muni Broadband Providers Have Required Users to Accept Unlawfully Vague and Discretionary Speech Codes, and Banned Constitutionally-Protected Speech Bizarrely, my critics further responded that I had failed to provide historical ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of First Amendment mischief by muni networks.  Perhaps they were confused about how a constitutional violation works.  A state action or law can violate the First Amendment as applied or on its face.  In the case of the latter, the law or act is always unconstitutional, and in the case of the former, it is only unconstitutional to the extent of a particular application.  My argument was not based on as-applied historical instances of censorship, but on facial grounds.  That is, certain terms in the muni broadband codes I cited facially violate the First Amendment.  For example, it is obviously facially problematic to ban speech that is ‚Äúexcessive and/or intended to annoy or harass others.‚Äù  What does that even mean?  Are Chattanooga‚Äôs network users prohibited from trolling on Twitter?  Allowing the government wide discretion to define what is ‚Äúexcessive and/or intended to annoy‚Äù leaves tremendous room for discretion and bias.  And, since these terms are so vague, it would be practically impossible to be certain in advance what speech would be unlawful, leading to an unacceptable chilling effect on users.  Indeed, it is for that latter reason that the Supreme Court has treated vague limits on speech as particularly suspect. Worse, Concord Light threatens to block content that fits into certain proscribed categories ‚Äúor otherwise, in its reasonable discretion.‚Äù  That‚Äôs not even a vague standard; it‚Äôs no standard at all!  Such an enormously discretionary provision gives absolutely no notice of what speech is proscribed, and, moreover, allows those enforcing the speech code to do so in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.  Granted, not all speech prohibited under the terms of service I cited is protected under the First Amendment ‚Äî for example, defamation is an unprotected category of speech.  However, Concord and Chattanooga‚Äôs terms additionally ban large swaths of constitutionally-protected speech.  For instance, Concord bans speech that ‚Äúdegrades, threatens, or victimizes an individual, group or class of individuals or an entity,‚Äù while Chattanooga has proscribed transmission of ‚Äúhateful‚Äù content.  In other words, both providers ban hate speech, which the Supreme Court has repeatedly held to be protected under the First Amendment.  One principle undergirding our First Amendment jurisprudence is that outside of a few narrow exceptions, the government may not suppress speech based on content, and viewpoint-based discrimination is presumptively invalid.  Paraphrasing Justice Kennedy, we don‚Äôt entrust to the government the power of determining which ideas are suitable for public discourse, and instead rely on ‚Äúfree and open discussion in a democratic society‚Äù to root out toxic ideas.  In the muni broadband case, as in others, the answer to hateful speech isn‚Äôt to ban it, but to promote and engage in counter-speech. Despite the apparent facial inconsistency of the content-restrictive terms of service with the First Amendment, one area for debate might be whether muni broadband networks constitute public fora, and therefore entitle users to full free speech rights.  After all, not all speech fora created by the government provide full-stop access and preclude the state operator from censoring content.  In AETC v. Forbes, the Supreme Court found that a state-owned broadcast television station was not a public forum and that the station‚Äôs decision to exclude a candidate from a political debate did not violate the Constitution.  Since a broadcast TV station must necessarily make editorial choices, the Supreme Court did not want to second-guess acts of journalistic discretion and found that unrestricted rights of access for speakers were unworkable in that context.  However, I would argue that this analysis simply doesn‚Äôt apply in the muni broadband context, where editorial choices are not necessarily required, and the municipality is offering the Internet under the guise of expanding digital access and communication.  According to precedent, a fundamental consideration in determining whether a government speech forum grants fulsome access rights is whether the essential nature of the forum is to enable the exchange of ideas.  In our current era, a muni broadband network billed as offering the full Internet would seem to represent such a speech forum, and therefore creates a situation where content-based censorship of protected categories of speech would mandate strict scrutiny.  This view is further reinforced by the Supreme Court‚Äôs view of online spaces.  In Packingham v. North Carolina, the Supreme Court stated that while in the past, streets and parks represented quintessential government-created public fora, ‚Äúcyberspace [‚Ä¶] and social media in particular‚Äù have become the most important places for ‚Äúthe exchange of views‚Äù in this day and age.  A project allowing the government vast power to police online content should therefore justify extreme apprehension. *             *             *   I spoke at the Media Institute in defense of the First Amendment.  The past few weeks have been punctuated with attacks on my speech, each failing to grapple with the major constitutional problems raised by muni broadband speech codes.  Censorship by government poses a true threat to a free and open Internet, but my critics somehow want us to believe that restrictions on speech are less dangerous when the government owns and operates the network.  Nothing could be further from the truth, and, in taking such a position, some of my critics seem to reveal their disingenuousness in claiming to support free speech online. I could retreat in the face of my critics‚Äô attacks and misinformation, or I could continue to defend the First Amendment.  I choose the latter, and better, course of action.

42	911: A Look Back and a Look Forward	Lisa M. Fowlkes	2018-12-11 09:45:00	1544546700.0	There is no higher priority at the FCC than promoting reliable 911 service.  As we approach the end of 2018, I thought I‚Äôd recap our work this year to strengthen emergency calling and highlight some of our next steps for 2019. Improving 911 Calling from Multi-Line Telephone Systems The year began with a national focus on 911: February marked the 50th anniversary of the first 911 call, and the President signed two new laws to improve emergency calling.  The FCC then began work to implement these statutes. First, Kari‚Äôs Law requires multi-line telephone systems‚Äîwhich commonly serve hotels, office buildings, and campuses‚Äîto enable users to dial 911 directly, without having to dial a prefix (such as a ‚Äú9‚Äù) to reach an outside line.  Kari‚Äôs Law also requires multi-line telephone systems to provide notification, such as to a front desk or security office, when a 911 call is made in order to facilitate building entry by first responders.  In September, the FCC proposed rules to provide clarity and specificity to these statutory requirements so that companies can effectively meet their obligations. Our work on this continues. Second, RAY BAUM‚ÄôS Act requires the FCC to consider adopting rules to ensure that ‚Äúdispatchable location‚Äù information‚Äîessentially the street address, floor level, and room number of a 911 caller‚Äîis conveyed with 911 calls, regardless of the technological platform used.  The FCC proposed rules that would apply dispatchable location requirements to multi-line telephone systems, interconnected VoIP, and other platforms that support 911 calling.  We are hard at work to complete this effort by our statutory deadline of September 2019. Examining How to Route Wireless 911 Calls More Quickly Another issue we‚Äôre tackling is how to route wireless 911 calls to the correct call center more quickly, which can lead to faster response times. Here‚Äôs the challenge: wireless 911 calls are currently routed to 911 call centers based on the location of the cell tower that handles the call.  But in some cases‚Äîfor example, if a 911 call is made near a county or a city border‚Äîthe nearest cell tower may be in a neighboring jurisdiction.  In these cases, the call is routed to a 911 call center in that neighboring jurisdiction, not the call center that serves the caller‚Äôs location.  These wireless 911 calls must then be transferred to the proper call center, which can waste valuable time during emergencies. Earlier this year, the FCC launched an examination into the extent of these ‚Äúmisrouted‚Äù wireless 911 calls and ways to route emergency calls more quickly.  In particular, we sought public input on the feasibility of routing wireless 911 calls based on the location of the caller as opposed to the location of the cell tower that handles that call.  Advances in location technology may soon make that possible.  We are reviewing the input in this proceeding and considering how the FCC can best promote wireless 911 call routing improvements.  Helping First Responders Locate Wireless 911 Callers We also remain focused on helping emergency responders better locate people who make wireless 911 calls from indoors, which is increasingly common as consumers ‚Äúcut the cord‚Äù on landline phone service.  Locating indoor callers is particularly challenging in environments such as large multi-story buildings, where first responders may lose precious time finding the caller‚Äôs floor and room.   A few years ago, the FCC updated its Enhanced 911 rules, which require wireless providers to automatically transmit to 911 call centers information on the location of wireless 911 calls.  The updated rules require wireless providers to meet an increasingly stringent series of new location accuracy benchmarks over the years that apply to both indoor and outdoor calls.   Wireless providers have been hard at work improving location technology to meet the new requirements.  Earlier this year, the four nationwide providers committed to incorporating the device-based location technologies found in most smartphones into their Enhanced 911 location solutions.  The providers are also building a national database that will give first responders the dispatchable location of 911 calls from many indoor locations.  In addition, we are tackling the next frontier in Enhanced 911: identifying a wireless 911 caller‚Äôs vertical location (the so-called ‚Äúz-axis‚Äù) in tall buildings, whether or not dispatchable location is available.  Industry completed testing and put forth a proposal for measuring z-axis accuracy, which we published for public comment.  We are studying the record very closely and expect that the Commission will act on this in 2019. Promoting Transparency About State 911 Fees Each year we submit a report to Congress on the collection and spending of 911 fees on the state and local level.  These reports contain a wealth of information about the status of 911 funding and deployment ‚Äîand, most notably, shine a light on the unfortunate practice of 911 fee diversion by a small number of states, where the 911 fees paid by the public are used for purposes unrelated to 911.  We are now finalizing our tenth annual report and plan to submit it to Congress by the end of the year.  As always, we plan to subsequently publish it online in early 2019. Lastly, I want to emphasize that strengthening 911 is not the FCC‚Äôs job alone; it‚Äôs a team effort.  In 2019, we will continue to work collaboratively with public safety organizations, government partners, industry, public interest groups, and other stakeholders on this important mission.   -#-	"{0: {'username': 'Saasha', 'date_epoch': 1566552720.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-08-23 02:32:00', 'response_content': 'Good article.

43	Decommissioning of the National Broadband Map and its APIs	Rich Mansfield	2018-12-07 15:55:00	1544223300.0	Since 2011, the National Broadband Map has been a vital tool for consumers, businesses, policy makers, and researchers by providing an easy- to-use and searchable way to find out who is offering broadband, what types of broadband they are offering, and where they are offering it.  But the mapping platform has become dated, as has the coverage data, which was collected through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration‚Äôs (NTIA) State Broadband Initiative (SBI); the last published SBI data set was current as of June 30, 2014.  Based on the age of the data, and the underlying technology, the National Broadband Map and its Application Program Interface (API), will be decommissioned on December 21, 2018. Recognizing the value of broadband data visualizations, the Federal Communications Commission released a new Fixed Broadband Deployment map in February 2018 to display new data collected by the FCC from carriers on FCC Form 477, which is updated twice annually. Like the old map, the new map provides key information about broadband deployment for consumers, policymakers, researchers, economists, and others. The new Fixed Broadband Deployment map, maps of Mobile Broadband and other maps and resources are available at: Fixed Broadband Deployment map and resources: Map Link: https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/ Developer Resources: https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/about Mobile Broadband maps and resources: 20Th Mobile Wireless Report, Web Appendix I: Coverage Maps at https://www.fcc.gov/20th-mobile-wireless-report-web-appendices.

44	Status Update: Fixing 9-1-1 Fee Diversion	Michael O'Rielly	2018-11-29 10:05:00	1543511100.0	It's now been almost ten months since my colleague, Commissioner Rosenworcel, and I penned an op-ed in The Hill reaffirming the need to end states' diversion of critical 9-1-1 fees collected from consumers to non-9-1-1 functions. Since that time, important legislation has been introduced and considered in the House of Representatives that would provide the Commission with an enhanced role in determining what exactly constitutes 9-1-1 fee diversion. This is an important step. Once the Commission provides a clear definition of diversion, and states may no longer thwart consumer expectations by passing laws permitting such diversion, diversionary practices should decline. But a more comprehensive bill may be needed to deal with recalcitrant states committed to diversion. In addition to supporting a legislative response, I have visited and worked with those states found to be diverters in the Commission's 2017 Report. I also wrote to those states and territories that failed to respond to the Commission's request for data. In June, I published a blog highlighting both my successes and failures in my outreach to these states. To be completely candid, even though citizens I met with in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island were outraged by the practices of their state governments, naming-and-shaming hasn't eradicated the problem of fee diversion. Nonetheless, there have been some successes. With six months passing since my last report card, and in anticipation of the Commission's next statutory report due out at the end of the year, it seems appropriate to provide another status update. Of the five self-reported diverting states and seven states and territories that did not respond to the Commission's inquiry (for a total of 12), two states (Illinois and Oklahoma) and one territory (Northern Mariana Islands) remedied filing errors to clarify that they are not diverters; one state (West Virginia) and one territory (Puerto Rico) are in the process of ending diversion within their borders; and one state (New Mexico) has ended its diversionary practices going forward. This leaves five states and one territory (New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Missouri, Montana, and Guam) that have not yet either provided the Commission with their 2016 state data or ended their explicit and despicable practice of stealing 9-1-1 fees for their own discretionary spending.   1 National Association of State Budget Officers, State Expenditure Report, Examining Fiscal 2015-2017 State Spending, https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/SER%20Archive/State_Expenditure_Report__Fiscal_2015-2017_-S.pdf  	"{0: {'username': 'Van C.

45	The FCC‚Äôs Thanksgiving Menu: 5G, Rural Broadband, and Stopping Unwanted Robocalls	Ajit Pai	2018-11-20 13:35:00	1542746100.0	This week, families all across the country will be traveling over the river and through the woods to grandmother‚Äôs house for Thanksgiving dinner. And after a tried-and-true combination of turkey, pumpkin pie, repartee, and football, millions of Americans will fall into a food coma. One thing that might wake them up (well, probably not, but it can‚Äôt hurt to try) is the prospect of another breakthrough in U.S. leadership on 5G‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääspecifically, the FCC‚Äôs upcoming move at our December open meeting to make yet more spectrum available for the next generation of wireless technology. Last week, the Commission launched the first of two auctions of high-band spectrum (28 GHz, to be followed by 24 GHz) that was previously thought to be useless, but can now be used for 5G. And today, I‚Äôm circulating an order that would enable the Commission to move forward with an auction of the Upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands by the end of 2019. In combination, the Upper 37 GHz and the 39 GHz bands offer the largest amount of contiguous spectrum in the millimeter-wave bands for flexible-use wireless services‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa total of 2,400 megahertz‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the 47 GHz band will provide an additional 1,000 megahertz of millimeter-wave spectrum for such services. Notably, this would be the second time the Commission uses an incentive auction format. And combined, all of these auctions will free up more spectrum than is currently used to provide terrestrial mobile broadband by all providers combined. From wireless to wired: One thing you can‚Äôt count on if your grandma lives in one of America‚Äôs most remote rural communities is access to high-speed broadband. So in December, we‚Äôll continue to pursue our goal of closing the digital divide with a measure to help connect some of America‚Äôs hardest-to-reach communities. Here‚Äôs how. The FCC administers what is known as the Universal Service Fund, or USF. You pay into the USF through your phone bill, typically with a line-item called a ‚Äúuniversal service fee.‚Äù The USF has several programs aimed at helping close the digital divide. This includes what we call our high-cost program, which subsidizes rural-focused carriers called rate-of-return carriers as they build broadband networks in some of the most difficult-to-serve parts of our country. There are a few basic principles that animate‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor should‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe high-cost program. First, subsidies should provide maximum incentive to be efficient; we want to stretch taxpayer dollars as far as possible. Second, subsidies should be sufficient to build out networks; after all, these are areas where the business case for private investment is lacking. Third, the program should support high-quality services; rural Americans deserve services that are comparable to those in urban areas. And fourth, subsidies should be predictable; after all, building networks is a serious long-term proposition, not a one-time whim. Unfortunately, for many, many years, the program hasn‚Äôt satisfied each of these important principles. We‚Äôre hoping to change that in December. First, we‚Äôre working to promote efficiency by moving away from simply telling rate-of-return carriers what their allowable costs and return on investment will be and toward setting broad goals for deployment and rewarding companies for being efficient in meeting those goals (what‚Äôs called an ‚Äúincentive-based‚Äù model). Specifically, we‚Äôre offering rate-of-return carriers another opportunity to opt in to model-based support, which would give them a guaranteed revenue stream for a decade in exchange for meeting specified buildout requirements. Second, we‚Äôre ensuring support is sufficient by offering additional funding to carriers that currently receive model-based support and who agree to meet increased buildout requirements. We‚Äôre also increasing funding for carriers who do not receive model-based support. Third, we‚Äôre recognizing that rural Americans need and deserved high-quality services by increasing the target speeds for subsidized deployments from 10/1 Mbps to 25/3 Mbps. And fourth, we‚Äôre making the program more predictable by setting a new long-term budget for rate-of-return carriers who choose not to opt in to model-based support and ending arbitrary funding cuts. Long story short, we‚Äôre making the Universal Service Fund a more efficient, effective way of distributing funding to close the digital divide. From what we want (rural broadband) to what we don‚Äôt, combatting unwanted robocalls tops our consumer protection agenda. Just two weeks ago, I called on the phone industry to implement a robust call authentication system to combat illegal caller ID spoofing and launch that system no later than next year. Also this month, the Commission sent letters to voice providers, calling on them to assist industry efforts to trace scam robocalls that originate on or pass through their networks, which can assist the FCC in identifying the source of illegal calls. At our December meeting, we can take another important action to curb the tide of unwanted calls by addressing the issue of calls to phone numbers that have been reassigned. Consumer groups and legitimate businesses that place calls (say, pharmacies or local banks) have repeatedly asked the FCC to enable callers to quickly learn of all reassignments. The problem is two-fold. On the one hand, consumers who have a reassigned number can receive unwanted calls intended for the previous number-holder. At the same time, the consumer that used to have that number can miss time-sensitive, important calls like fraud alerts, calls from a child‚Äôs school, or notifications from a doctor‚Äôs office. In three weeks, the FCC will vote on new rules to tackle this problem by establishing a single, comprehensive database that will contain reassigned number information from each provider that obtains phone numbers for use in America‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääspecifically, North American Numbering Plan (NANP) U.S. geographic numbers. The database will enable any caller to verify whether a telephone number has been reassigned before calling that number. These rules would reduce the number of unwanted calls consumers receive and enable businesses to make sure they are not wasting your‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor their‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätime. On a related note, we want to help shield consumers from unwanted contacts on their phones, no matter what kind of contact it is. As you surely know, the preferred method of communication among many Americans is increasingly text messaging. Thankfully, wireless messaging remains a relatively spam-free service. The spam rate for text messages is estimated at 2.8%, compared to a rate of over 50% for email. That‚Äôs not by accident. Today‚Äôs wireless messaging providers apply filtering to prevent large volumes of unwanted messages from ever reaching your phone. However, there‚Äôs been an effort underway to put these successful consumer protections at risk. In 2015, a mass-texting company named Twilio petitioned the FCC, arguing that wireless messaging should be classified as a ‚Äútelecommunications service.‚Äù This may not seem like a big deal, but such a classification would dramatically curb the ability of wireless providers to use robotext-blocking, anti-spoofing, and other anti-spam features. So I‚Äôm circulating a Declaratory Ruling that would instead classify wireless messaging as an ‚Äúinformation service.‚Äù Aside from being a more legally sound approach, this decision would keep the floodgates to a torrent of spam texts closed, remove regulatory uncertainty, and empower providers to continue finding innovative ways to protect consumers from unwanted text messages. On the media front, we‚Äôll be kicking off a review of our media ownership rules‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa review we‚Äôre required by statute to conduct every four years. The 2018 Quadrennial Review, as it‚Äôs called, will begin with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which seeks public input on the relevant rules, such as the Local Radio Ownership Rule, as well as several diversity-related proposals. As part of the Commission‚Äôs ongoing Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, we will also consider an order to eliminate certain rules that require broadcast licensees to maintain and display copies of their licenses and other related materials in specific locations, such as at their transmitter sites. Now that licensing information is readily accessible online through the FCC‚Äôs databases, these rules are redundant and obsolete. Turning from repealing to reporting: The FCC has long been required by law to submit a variety of reports to Congress. Each of these reports used to be issued as separate documents and at different times, making it hard for elected officials and the public to track everything down. To streamline these reports into a single document providing a comprehensive evaluation of the state of the communications marketplace in the United States, Congress, in the RAY BAUM‚ÄôS Act of 2018, required the FCC to craft every two years what we are calling our Communications Marketplace Report. The draft report I‚Äôm circulating for my colleagues‚Äô consideration consolidates many of the reports that the Commission had been previously required to produce. For the first time, the Report places essential information about mobile wireless, video, audio, wireline broadband, voice telephony, satellite, broadband deployment, and international broadband all in one place. In the spirit of the season, I want to close by expressing my gratitude to the men and women at the FCC who worked so hard on these items, and who work year-round to improve the lives of the American people. I can‚Äôt say thank you enough to these dedicated public servants. They are the best co-workers anyone could ask for, and I wish the American people could know all of them and their accomplishments. To them and to you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhether you‚Äôre heading to grandmother‚Äôs house or staying put this week‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähere‚Äôs wishing everyone a Happy Thanksgiving.

46	Space Month at the FCC	Ajit Pai	2018-10-24 13:30:00	1540413000.0	With the Neil Armstrong biopic First Man in theaters, many Americans have been fondly remembering and celebrating the achievements of the U.S. space program in the 1960s. While America‚Äôs first astronauts have been appropriately lionized by historians and filmmakers, they are only part of America‚Äôs rich history of space exploration.  Less noted but also historic, in July 1962, the U.S. launched into space Telstar, the first active communications satellite. This enabled the first live, trans-Atlantic television broadcast. To put the importance of satellites into perspective, then-FCC Chairman Newton Minow famously told President Kennedy, ‚ÄúCommunications satellites are more important than sending a man into space because they will launch ideas, and ideas will last longer than men and women.‚Äù Inspirational words indeed. In crafting the Commission‚Äôs November agenda, I was also struck by Chairman Minow‚Äôs less-well-known comments made to a Congressional panel.  When asked by Senator Russell Long of Louisiana how the U.S. could stay ahead of the Russians, Minow said, ‚ÄúWe should try to get the Russians to adopt the same bureaucratic regulatory system we have for communications[,] . . . which will tie them up in red tape.‚Äù  To this day, satellites continue to deliver tremendous benefits for the American people.  So in November, during what we‚Äôve dubbed Space Month, the FCC will take up nine items to ensure that America leads in the New Space Age, with an emphasis on cutting through the red tape.  We start with improving a satellite-enabled technology that millions of Americans rely on every day without even knowing it: the positioning, navigation, and timing service known to most Americans as the Global Positioning System, or GPS.  Consumers regularly use GPS to navigate while driving, to locate a store, and even to find our phones.  Meanwhile, businesses are using GPS for high-precision agriculture, fleet tracking, and monitoring drones.  Given all these uses, it‚Äôs important for us to take steps to improve GPS when we can.  That‚Äôs why the Commission will vote in November on allowing American devices to access the European global navigation satellite system, known as Galileo.  Enabling the Galileo system to work in concert with the U.S. GPS constellation should make GPS more precise, reliable, and resilient‚Äîa boon to consumers and businesses alike. Speaking of constellations, we‚Äôll also be voting on a package of orders that would give the green light to companies seeking to roll out new and expanded services using new non-geostationary satellite constellations.  Kepler is looking to create a new satellite system for the Internet of Things, and LeoSat would like to offer high-speed connectivity for enterprises and underserved communities.  We‚Äôre aiming to approve both requests.  And we‚Äôve also targeted for approval the requests of SpaceX and TeleSat Canada to expand the frequencies they can use so that their fleets of low Earth orbit satellites can offer even better broadband service. To help these new constellations have a real impact down here on Earth, we‚Äôre also looking to expand the opportunities for satellites to serve Earth Stations in Motion (ESIMs). We started down this path in September, when we made it easier for geostationary-orbit satellites to target ESIMs, improving the transmission of data to moving vehicles like ships, airplanes, or school buses. Building on that item, I‚Äôve circulated a proposal to expand the scope of our ESIMs rules to cover communications with non-geostationary orbit satellites. This proposal would unlock new uses of satellites, ensuring that those who need broadband on-the-go can access the technology that best meets their needs. Two more space items should help ensure our rules don‚Äôt hold back the launch of new satellite systems. One proposal would create a new unified license for space stations and earth stations operating in a geostationary, fixed-satellite service satellite network.  A product of the FCC‚Äôs 2016 Biennial Review, the proposal would provide a new, streamlined license option for satellite operators and would reduce unnecessary reporting burdens.  Another proposal would update our rules governing direct broadcast satellite service so that it too could benefit from the streamlining of our rules for launching satellite service in other bands. Now, it‚Äôs true here on Earth that what goes up must come down.  But that‚Äôs not always the case in space. There are more things being launched into space, resulting in more orbital debris milling about.  This reduces the space available for new satellites and satellite systems and increases the risk profile of every launch. In space, even a centimeter-wide object can wreak devastating damage to satellites.  If you want a graphic illustration of the problem, just rewatch the movie Gravity.  And the problem of orbital debris is only set to grow as we see the deployment of CubeSats and other small, relatively inexpensive satellites, thousands of which can be deployed in constellations.  We‚Äôll have to address this growing risk in order to preserve our ability to promote more innovation and investment in space. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve proposed the first comprehensive review of the Commission‚Äôs orbital debris rules since their adoption in 2004. This proposal aims to improve and clarify these rules based on improvements in mitigation practices, and to address recent market developments. Even though it‚Äôs Space Month, there‚Äôs still more work to do on the ground. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôll also vote on a Report and Order involving hearing aid compatibility. This proposal would strengthen our website disclosure requirements for wireless service providers, ensuring consumers can find the information they need.  It also would eliminate unnecessary and outdated wireless hearing aid compatibility reporting requirements and replace them with a streamlined annual certification.  And finally, as part of the Commission‚Äôs ongoing Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, we‚Äôll also consider a Report and Order to update certain notice requirements that principally apply to cable operators. Among other things, we‚Äôll allow these companies to send written communications to subscribers via e-mail, rather than by paper mail. Some might say that nine space-related items on the agenda for a monthly meeting is overdoing it.  During Space Month, I would instead say that we have dared to boldly go where no FCC has gone before.	{0: {'username': 'Saasha', 'date_epoch': 1566732540.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-08-25 04:29:00', 'response_content': 'Looks very good and informative.

47	Emergency Alert Testing Matters	Lisa M. Fowlkes	2018-10-02 13:10:00	1538511000.0	‚ÄúThis is only a test.‚Äù You‚Äôve no doubt heard or read those words countless times during local tests of the Emergency Alert System, accompanied by the familiar attention-grabbing sounds on your television or radio. Testing is an essential part of ensuring that emergency alert systems work, both by validating operational readiness and by uncovering areas for improvement.  While local tests of the Emergency Alert System occur frequently, the system has also been tested three times on the national level.  Tomorrow, October 3, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in coordination with the FCC, will conduct the fourth national test of the Emergency Alert System.    Two minutes prior to the Emergency Alert System test, FEMA will also initiate the first national test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system.   Both test messages will be transmitted over FEMA‚Äôs Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), a central gateway that is used to transmit alerts from government agencies to the public.  Both messages will state that they are only tests. As with past national Emergency Alert System tests, EAS participants‚Äîthe radio and television broadcasters, cable systems, satellite radio and television providers, and wireline video providers that deliver the alerts to the public‚Äîare required to report to the FCC how the test fared.  We then analyze the results and work with stakeholders, including industry and FEMA, to strengthen the system. In addition, while members of the public certainly do not need to take any action, we welcome feedback on your experience with the Wireless Emergency Alert test.  We also plan to engage with FEMA and wireless providers to learn more about how the wireless test performed. Making State and Local Testing Easier To be clear, Wireless Emergency Alert testing is not new.  Participating wireless providers are already required to support certain monthly tests, which check their network connections to FEMA‚Äôs IPAWS alerting gateway.  But unlike those tests, which are typically unseen by consumers, the upcoming nationwide test will reach the general public‚Äîthat is, people whose wireless carrier participates in the Wireless Emergency Alert program and who have a compatible handset that is turned on and receiving service in an area where the program is supported.  In addition, beginning on May 1, 2019, state and local emergency managers will be able to conduct their own end-to-end Wireless Emergency Alert tests to assess how the service is working within their jurisdictions.  This timeframe enables industry to develop a means for consumers to opt-in to the tests, so that those who do not wish to participate do not receive test messages.  In the meantime, state and local governments must seek a waiver from the FCC to conduct end-to-end tests.  We‚Äôve already granted several waivers.  And, based in part on the press accounts of these local tests, we are seeking comment on issues related to the delivery of Wireless Emergency Alerts to the public.  This is part of our ongoing effort to strengthen wireless alerting. The FCC also recently took action to support more effective local tests of the Emergency Alert System, including adopting procedures for state and local officials to conduct ‚Äúlive code‚Äù tests.  These tests, which use the same alert codes and processes as would be used in actual emergencies, can increase the proficiency of local alerting officials while educating the public about how to respond to actual alerts.  The procedures require appropriate coordination, planning, and disclaimers to accompany any ‚Äúlive code‚Äù tests.   Speaking of resources to increase alert originator proficiency, here is a reminder that FEMA maintains an IPAWS Lab where alerting authorities can regularly practice and train.  The Lab provides a closed IPAWS testing environment along with representative cell phone, radio, and television devices, which enable authorities to safely see how their alerts would appear to the public on a wireless device or television screen.  Lessons Learned Another way we continue to improve emergency alerting is by sharing lessons learned.  Earlier this year, the FCC convened a wide range of stakeholders‚Äîincluding state and local emergency managers, public safety officials, federal agency representatives, and industry members‚Äîto discuss best practices related to emergency alert testing and proficiency training.  Among the key takeaways from the roundtable, there was agreement that alert originators should establish standard operating procedures and conduct training to ensure staff are able to use the Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alerts during emergencies, but also to practice how to effectively use social media.  For example, social media can be a valuable tool for communicating with non-English-speaking audiences.  It‚Äôs important to understand the capabilities and limitations of all alerting tools when developing a comprehensive alerting plan to meet your community‚Äôs needs. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with stakeholders as we work together to keep strengthening the nation‚Äôs emergency alerting systems.

48	Keeping Up A Fast Pace On Spectrum	Ajit Pai	2018-10-01 13:05:00	1538424300.0	Last Friday, I had the honor of participating in a White House summit on 5G, the next generation of wireless communications.  At the event, I discussed the FCC‚Äôs plan to Facilitate American Superiority in 5G Technology.  Our 5G FAST plan focuses on freeing up spectrum, promoting wireless infrastructure, and modernizing regulations.  It will help deliver unprecedented benefits to wireless consumers in this country. And on the heels of the summit‚Äôs conclusion, I‚Äôm pleased to announce that the FCC‚Äôs October agenda will address three issues critical to advancing the 5G FAST Plan‚Äîcreating more opportunities for unlicensed innovation in the 6 GHz band, expanding spectrum opportunities for 5G in the 3.5 GHz band, and updating our business data services rules for smaller, rural carriers in order to promote fiber deployment. Let‚Äôs start with something we all know and love: Wi-Fi.  Wi-Fi was enabled by the FCC‚Äôs decision to make certain spectrum available for unlicensed use‚Äîthat is, anybody could use these airwaves without having to get approval from the FCC (as long as they weren‚Äôt causing harmful interference to others).  As Wi-Fi has become more popular, so has the demand for more unlicensed spectrum to accommodate this traffic.  Last year, the FCC launched an inquiry on how to expand unlicensed use in the 6 GHz band.  Based on this study, I‚Äôm proposing new rules allowing unlicensed devices to use this band.  My proposal would promote efficient use of spectrum that may otherwise not be used at all‚Äîand it could make over 1 gigahertz of new unlicensed spectrum available.  This last point bears elaboration: this massive amount of spectrum could enable faster Wi-Fi connections and substantially expand the reach of Internet access providers that use unlicensed spectrum, like small, competitive fixed wireless companies.  And it would enable mobile broadband companies to supplement their licensed holdings for 5G.  We hope to do all this while fully protecting existing and future licensed operations from harmful interference. Next, let‚Äôs turn to making more licensed spectrum available for 5G.  In the coming months, we‚Äôll be auctioning off high-band, millimeter-wave spectrum (that‚Äôs the 28 GHz and 24 GHz auctions, the first of which is slated to start on November 14).  But we also want to free up mid-band spectrum for 5G and other flexible uses.  Commissioner Mike O‚ÄôRielly has taken the lead on exploring ways to better use the 3.5 GHz band, and I commend him for his efforts.  This month, we‚Äôll take up the plan he‚Äôs developed.  It makes targeted changes to our rules to promote investment and innovation in this important band.  For example, by allowing providers to renew 3.5 GHz licenses, we will substantially increase their incentives to deploy 5G networks using this spectrum.  Speaking of promoting investment, we‚Äôll also vote on modernizing our rules governing business data services for certain small rural carriers‚Äîspecifically, those known as Alternative Connect America Model, or A-CAM, carriers.  Easy enough, right?  Back in March, when I teed up this proposal, I warned you that this issue is ‚Äúadmittedly a little arcane.‚Äù  That hasn‚Äôt changed‚Äîbut neither has the pro-rural impact.  This order would enable rural companies to take resources currently wasted on regulatory compliance and devote them to building stronger networks and delivering better services.  This is important because the wireless networks of the future will rely on these high-capacity broadband connections for ‚Äúbackhaul,‚Äù which essentially means the wires that carry traffic from a wireless small cell or tower back to the core of a network.  And much more backhaul will be needed for the 5G future‚Äîparticularly for those living in rural America. Telecom policy has dominated this post so far, but I haven‚Äôt forgotten the media side of the ledger.  Continuing our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, I‚Äôm making two proposals to update our media rules to reflect today‚Äôs marketplace, bringing the total number of rulemakings under this effort to a lucky thirteen. The first proposal explores whether to fundamentally change the FCC‚Äôs decades-old cable rate regulatory scheme, with the goal of modernizing and simplifying our rules.  The industry has changed dramatically since these rules were adopted.  Because of increasing competition in the video marketplace, our rate regulations today only apply to a very small percentage of our nation‚Äôs cable systems.  Yet, we have pages and pages of rate regulation rules on the books that are inordinately complicated and characterized by complex rate regulation forms.  It‚Äôs time to take a hard look at updating and simplifying these regulations. The other Media Modernization item on the agenda recognizes this thing called the Internet, ending a filling requirement that requires broadcasters to submit paper copies of certain contracts to the FCC. Given that television stations along with AM and FM radio stations are already required to allow the public to obtain these documents through their online public inspection files, it no longer makes sense to mandate that broadcasters send hard copies of these documents to the Commission. Media regulations aren‚Äôt the only ones yellowing with age.  For far too long, companies have been struggling under our arcane rules for narrowband services, or ‚Äúprivate land mobile radio‚Äù services as they‚Äôre commonly called.  For example, today companies have to request waivers to take advantage of new, more efficient technology and repurpose gaps in frequencies that are going unused.  So we‚Äôre taking steps to enable more intensive use of this workhorse spectrum on which first responders, state and local governments, large and small businesses, electric utilities, transportation providers, the medical community, and many others depend.  I recognize the critical role narrowband spectrum plays in our economy.  That‚Äôs why we‚Äôll vote on (among other things) eliminating unnecessary restrictions in our rules, boosting capacity by making way for new ‚Äúinterstitial‚Äù channels, and ending an outdated ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù on spectrum sharing that was first put into place in 1995. Also, on this month‚Äôs agenda will be an item from the FCC‚Äôs Enforcement Bureau.  You know the drill by now:  The FCC can‚Äôt discuss law enforcement matters publicly before we vote on them, and as it was once memorably put, even I am not above the policy.   With that, here‚Äôs wishing everybody a happy October.

49	Saying Goodbye to Summer Vacation	Ajit Pai	2018-09-04 14:10:00	1536095400.0	August is supposed to be the slowest month of the year in Washington, but it‚Äôs been as hectic for me as it‚Äôs been humid. I spent the past few weeks launching a new podcast, awarding $1.5 billion to expand broadband to over 700,000 unserved rural homes and businesses, climbing a 131-foot-tall cell tower, and exploring how the IP-based Next Gen TV standard is progressing, among other things. Basically, I could write the wonkiest essay ever about what I did on my summer vacation. And things aren‚Äôt slowing down as we emerge from the Labor Day break! The FCC is coming out of the gate today with a full agenda for our September meeting. Leading off this month‚Äôs meeting will be a proposal to address problems with 911 calls placed from centralized communications systems ‚Äî like phones that are used in office buildings, schools, and hotels. The first problem involves making sure callers using these systems can get direct access to 911. These systems often require that you dial 9 to make an external call, which can create confusion and has caused too many 911 calls to not go through. The second problem is the lack of precise location and routing information that would help first responders find the caller. Too often, emergency responders only know the building or complex where the call is coming from, but not the room or office where help is needed. In September 2017, the FCC began to study this issue. The findings from that inquiry inform this proposal. Additionally, this proposal would implement provisions of the Kari‚Äôs Law Act. This legislation was enacted by Congress in March 2018. It requires direct access to 911 in multi-line telephone systems. I‚Äôve had the honor of getting to know Hank Hunt, whose daughter‚Äôs passing inspired Kari‚Äôs Law. I stood by his side three years ago in Marshall, Texas, when I announced the first results of my initiative to enable direct access to 911, and I stood by his side earlier this year when legislation named for his late daughter was signed. I‚Äôm grateful that on September 26, we‚Äôll honor his advocacy by proposing rules that can and will save lives. The next item on deck was actually previewed this morning by Commission Brendan Carr, who has been very capably spearheading our work to facilitate the deployment of next-generation wireless networks. As Commissioner Carr laid out in greater detail, this order focuses on two main issues: reducing excessive local fees for processing permits and allowing access to public rights of way, and addressing unreasonable delays in authorizing deployments. By updating our rules to make it easier to install wireless infrastructure, the Commission is taking another critical step to promote U.S. leadership in 5G wireless services. In addition to advancing high-profile issues like public safety and the next generation of wireless connectivity, our September meeting will also include important issues that dig into the regulatory weeds. A consistent theme of our efforts to modernize or repeal outdated rules is identifying data collections that can be streamlined or eliminated outright. One of those data collections on the media side is Form 325, which requires cable operators to submit information on how networks operate ‚Äî things like network structure, system-wide capacity, programming, and the number of subscribers. We‚Äôve found that much of the information on this form can be obtained from other sources without imposing a burden on cable operators and the Commission. Additionally, the video business has changed a lot, diminishing the usefulness of this form. In fact, the Commission in recent years has rarely used the information we collect through this form. So in three weeks, we‚Äôll hopefully vote to eliminate this unnecessary requirement. Another important media issue we‚Äôll consider is a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking addressing two issues raised by a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The topic is how local franchising authorities may regulate incumbent cable operators and cable television services. The proposals we‚Äôre teeing up are designed to promote competition by ensuring parity between incumbent cable operators and new entrants and to help ensure that local franchising requirements don‚Äôt discourage cable operators from investing in new facilities and services. Returning to the topic of my ‚Äúsummer vacation‚Äù: a couple of weeks ago, I found myself in the beautiful state of Utah. There, I ‚Äúvirtually met‚Äù the Superintendent of the Kane County School District, which has seven schools spread out over 4,000 square miles ‚Äî a district twice the size of Delaware. Students who play sports routinely spend hours shuttling to and from games across vast remote areas that lack wireless service. To help the students do their homework during this time, the school buses are equipped with Wi-Fi. That Wi-Fi connection is made possible by a satellite transmitting data to a receiver on the bus ‚Äî what we call an Earth Station in Motion (ESIM). That brings me to the next item on our agenda. Currently, ESIMs are regulated differently based on the type of vehicle they are attached to, whether it‚Äôs ships, airplanes, or school buses. This doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, so the FCC will be voting to consolidate and streamline these rules, eliminating burdens and adding frequencies where ESIMs can operate. If adopted, this item will enable a fast-growing segment of the satellite industry to innovate and invest in new technologies ‚Äî and to deliver high-speed services like those used by the kids on those Kane County buses. At the outset of this post, I mentioned the FCC‚Äôs investment of $1.5 billion for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Notably, that money was awarded using a competitive auction that harnessed market forces to ensure that these resources were distributed efficiently. Later this month, the FCC will vote to apply auctions to another arena, the allocation of toll-free numbers. We‚Äôll decide whether to establish the framework for an auction of certain numbers in the recently opened 833 toll-free code. Taking this step would help us determine how best to use competitive bidding to assign toll-free numbers in the future. Rounding out our agenda, we‚Äôll be voting on two matters from the FCC‚Äôs Enforcement Bureau. For law enforcement reasons, I can‚Äôt tell you about these matters publicly before our September meeting. But stay tuned. It‚Äôs going to be tough topping what I did this summer ‚Äî and I left off the visits to the cattle ranch in Colorado, potato farm in Idaho, and pueblos in rural New Mexico, among other things! But I‚Äôm glad to be able to report that we‚Äôre getting off to such a productive start this fall.	{0: {'username': 'S·ª≠a T·ªß L·∫°nh', 'date_epoch': 1596461160.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-08-03 06:26:00', 'response_content': 'so great !!!! http://dienlanhhuynhanh.com...'}, 1: {'username': 'ƒêi·ªán l·∫°nh Hu·ª≥nh Anh', 'date_epoch': 1594527180.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-07-11 21:13:00', 'response_content': 'a good article. see more http://dienlanhhuynhanh.com...'}, 2: {'username': 'lawyer2225', 'date_epoch': 1591081560.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-06-02 00:06:00', 'response_content': 'excellent.

50	What I Hope to Learn from the Tech Giants	Ajit Pai	2018-09-04 11:48:00	1536086880.0	This coming week, elected officials will have a chance to question those who run Silicon Valley tech giants ‚Äî including a hearing on September 5 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will feature Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. This public scrutiny comes at an important time, as Americans across the political spectrum debate the ever-increasing role of these massive companies in our economy and civic society. Here are a few things I hope to learn from these hearings. 1. Transparency Consumers interact with these digital platforms on a daily basis. We get our news from them. We interact with our family and friends on them. But how do these companies make decisions about what we see and what we don‚Äôt? And who makes those decisions? We still don‚Äôt know. Recently, for instance, The New York Times hired a left-wing editorial board member who used racially incendiary language in a plethora of tweets. Those tweets remained on the platform until they were deleted by the user, and she was never suspended. Last month, a conservative commentator took some of those same tweets, substituted a religious group for the racial category in order to, she argued, underscore the original tweets‚Äô repugnance ‚Äî and was promptly suspended. (To state the obvious, I do not support any of these tweets‚Äô sentiments in any way.) After public backlash, Twitter rescinded the suspension, attributing it to an ‚Äúerror.‚Äù But how was the suspension decision made? Was it by an algorithm or a human? How was the reversal decision made? Similar concerns have been raised with respect to how Twitter manages its own content (like Twitter Moments), how Facebook compiles its News Feed, and how Google orders its search results. Should these companies be more transparent about their business practices? Currently, the FCC imposes strict transparency requirements on companies that operate broadband networks ‚Äî how they manage their networks, performance characteristics, and the like. Yet consumers have virtually no insight into similar business practices by tech giants. Do steps need to be taken to ensure that consumers receive more information about how these companies operate, and if so, what should those steps be and who should take them? 2. Privacy Tech giants have enormous and unprecedented insight into every part of our daily lives. For instance, a recent Associated Press investigation found that ‚Äúmany Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you‚Äôve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.‚Äù (Bear in mind that Android currently has an 88% global mobile operating system market share.) Facebook has shared consumers‚Äô personal information with numerous entities, including foreign corporations that U.S. intelligence agencies have indicated raise national security concerns. Most consumers have no idea that their data is being shared in these ways. Most consumers have no idea how this data is being used. Do we need greater transparency when it comes to these companies‚Äô privacy practices? And should consumers have greater control over the use of their information? 3. Online expression The promise of digital platforms is that Americans can express themselves online in a way they couldn‚Äôt in the analog age. But recent developments suggest that this town square may not be as open as it seems. Almost one year ago, for instance, I observed that ‚Äúrecent experience shows that so-called edge providers are in fact deciding what content [we] see. These providers routinely block or discriminate against content they don‚Äôt like.‚Äù I pointed out that many content creators on Google‚Äôs YouTube platform, like PragerU, said their videos were ‚Äúdemonetized‚Äù ‚Äî that is, denied advertising revenue critical to their ability to speak online ‚Äî without explanation. And many Twitter users said their online messages were restricted without explanation, such as Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn‚Äôs video announcing her campaign for the U.S. Senate and one company‚Äôs statement on net neutrality (ironically, on a day advocating about the importance of net neutrality). The concerns I highlighted last year only continue. Just last month, for instance, Twitter and Facebook blocked an online campaign ad by Elizabeth Heng, a Cambodian-American Republican congressional candidate in California. The ad featured Khmer Rouge-era footage to underscore her point that her parents saw the United States as a beacon of freedom. After a public backlash, the companies relented and reversed their decisions. (Heng vowed to continue to ‚Äúfight for internet transparency, so that every American has a chance to be heard.‚Äù) In addition to the concerns about tech giants serving as gatekeepers of online content domestically, foreign business practices, too, are raising eyebrows. Recently, a bipartisan group of Senators wrote to Google about its reported plan to ‚Äúlaunch a censored version of its search engine in China . . . that would prohibit websites and search terms deemed objectionable by the Chinese government and Communist Party.‚Äù And late last year, Apple‚Äôs CEO gave a keynote address at the World Internet Conference in China, in which he said the company was ‚Äúproud to have worked alongside many of our partners in China to help build a community that will join a common future in cyberspace.‚Äù Translated properly, that is code for delivering a censored internet. To say the least, these practices would never be countenanced at home, not least by the tech giants themselves. These domestic and international trends might explain why last year, the CEO of a tech company called Cloudflare questioned whether it was ‚Äúthe right place for tech companies to be regulating the Internet.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt offer a solution, but he did say that ‚Äúwhat I know is not the right answer is that a cabal of ten tech executives with names like Matthew, Mark, Jack, [and] Jeff are the ones choosing what content goes online and what content doesn‚Äôt go online.‚Äù Indeed, there are plenty of cases in which tech giants decide what consumers see and what they don‚Äôt. So when we talk about protecting a free and open Internet, shouldn‚Äôt we be focusing on the part of the Internet economy where it is most at risk? More broadly: Are these tech giants running impartial digital platforms over which they don‚Äôt exercise editorial judgment when it comes to content? Or do they in fact decide what speech is allowed and what is not and discriminate based on ideology and/or political affiliation? And again, going back to the first point: where is the transparency? * * * These issues of online transparency, privacy, and free expression raise the question of public oversight. And some critics of these companies have called for strict, utility-style regulation. To be clear, I don‚Äôt believe that is the right answer. The government ‚Äî in particular, the Federal Communications Commission, which I have the privilege of leading ‚Äî shouldn‚Äôt regulate these entities like a water company. Among other things, because they are private entities, they do not violate the First Amendment when they make certain business judgments about content on their sites. At the same time, it‚Äôs important to have a serious conversation about these issues ‚Äî not least because these tech giants have come to have much greater influence over our economy and society. Twenty years ago, Google was a small startup. Today, its market capitalization is greater than that of Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter combined, along with the GDP of Sweden. And it as well as Facebook are gaining a powerful duopoly on digital advertising. Speaking of, fifteen years ago, Facebook was a relatively unknown website for college kids. Today, one out of every three people on Earth is its ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù Twitter is where everyone from politicians to celebrities to corporate executives makes news and where billions more can read about it and make their own. The public deserves to know more about how these companies operate. And we need to seriously think about whether the time has come for these companies to abide by new transparency obligations. After all, just as is the case with respect to broadband providers, consumers need accurate information in order to make educated choices about whether and how to use these tech giants‚Äô platforms. * * * I hope the upcoming congressional hearings can help us have a more informed debate about the practices of these tech giants. And I hope elected officials will thoughtfully explore matters like the ones I‚Äôve identified above. It‚Äôs time to have a full and open conversation about the realities of today‚Äôs Internet economy.

51	Coming Home	Ajit Pai	2018-07-11 13:35:00	1531341300.0	For the past few days, I‚Äôve been meeting with my foreign counterparts at the International Telecommunication Union‚Äôs Global Symposium for Regulators in Geneva, Switzerland.  As part of a panel discussion, I delivered remarks about the FCC‚Äôs strategy for seizing the opportunities and managing the challenges created by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.  I spoke about how connectivity can help deliver on the promise of these technologies‚Äîand how the FCC is prioritizing top drivers of connectivity like flexible-use spectrum and light-touch regulation of infrastructure.  It was a timely discussion.  That‚Äôs because today, as I travel back to the United States, I‚Äôm teeing up several measures that would advance these goals.  I‚Äôll ask my fellow Commissioners to vote on them at the FCC‚Äôs August 2 meeting. Leading off our August agenda will be 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity.  We‚Äôll finalize the rules for the auction of airwaves in the 28 GHz band and the auction of the 24 GHz band, which will follow immediately afterward.  One of the game-changers for 5G is that new technologies have made it possible to use millimeter-wave spectrum for mobile broadband.  With so many wanting so much spectrum for 5G, we‚Äôre moving as quickly as possible to make these bands available for commercial use.  Adopting these rules will pave the way for auctioning these 5G-critical airwaves and allow us to start the bidding on November 14. These will be the first auctions of high-band spectrum for 5G services, but they won‚Äôt be the last.  Specifically, I‚Äôm excited to announce my plan to move forward with a single auction of three more millimeter-wave spectrum bands‚Äîthe 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands‚Äîin the second half of 2019.  To help facilitate that auction on this timeline, I‚Äôm proposing rules to clean up the 39 GHz band and move incumbents into rationalized license holdings.  This will help make the 39 GHz band as attractive as possible for new bidders, while consolidating incumbent spectrum licenses into more usable blocks.  As part of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking we will consider at the FCC‚Äôs August meeting, I‚Äôm also proposing to have 100 MHz license blocks for the 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands, so they can more easily be auctioned together.  These are important steps that will help solidify U.S. leadership in 5G. Spectrum‚Äôs not the only key to 5G.  We‚Äôll also have to make network deployment‚Äîand in particular the smaller, denser infrastructure of 5G networks‚Äîeasier.  One of my first acts as Chairman was to create the Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee to develop expert recommendations on removing barriers that raise the costs and slow the buildout of communications infrastructure.  A key focus of the Committee was easing access to utility poles, and one of its recommendations was streamlining the process to ‚Äúmake ready‚Äù those poles for new attachments.  (Many poles already have electric utility, telephone, and cable lines attached to them.)  Instead of having multiple parties sequentially prepare poles for a new attacher, as is current practice, the process can be much quicker if a single construction crew does all the make-ready work at once.  By making it quicker and cheaper to attach to poles, we can accelerate network buildout and make it easier for new entrants to provide more broadband competition.  So I‚Äôve circulated an order that would adopt this so-called ‚Äúone-touch-make-ready‚Äù policy while at the same time ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect existing attachments and worker safety.  The order that we we‚Äôll vote on at our August meeting also makes clear that it is contrary to Federal law for states or localities to put in place moratoria on network buildout. Switching gears a bit, I‚Äôve talked a lot about the need to close America‚Äôs digital divide.  One of the reasons we want every American to have access to high-speed Internet connectivity is because of its potential to improve healthcare.  Broadband connectivity fuels a wide range of telehealth services, and as Commissioner Brendan Carr recently highlighted, there‚Äôs a movement in telehealth towards connected care everywhere.  Whether it‚Äôs via remote patient monitoring or mobile health apps, patients can see improved outcomes and lower costs through care that can be delivered directly to them regardless of where they‚Äôre physically located.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve asked Commissioner Carr to lead the FCC‚Äôs effort to explore ways the Commission can promote connected care everywhere.  We‚Äôll formalize this at our August meeting, where we‚Äôll be considering a Notice of Inquiry that would seek comment on a Universal Service Fund pilot program to support the delivery of telehealth services to low-income Americans, with a focus on services delivered beyond brick-and-mortar healthcare facilities. Earlier, I spoke of new spectrum auctions.  But we can‚Äôt forget that the Commission is still managing the transition of broadcasters following the incentive auction that concluded in 2017.  In RAY BAUM‚Äôs Act, Congress authorized the Commission to reimburse certain low power television and television translator stations, as well as FM radio stations, for costs incurred as a result of the post-incentive auction broadcast television repack.  And today, I‚Äôm circulating a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which seeks comment on rules to implement Congress‚Äô directive.  Our goal is to provide funds efficiently while at the same time ensuring that there are robust safeguards against waste, fraud, and abuse. Rounding out our August meeting agenda, we‚Äôll vote on establishing the requirements that will govern our broadcast ‚Äúincubator‚Äù program.  This program is one that the FCC envisioned last year to encourage the entry of new and diverse voices into the broadcast industry.  If adopted, my plan will enable the pairing of small aspiring, or struggling, broadcast station owners with established broadcasters who will provide assistance with training, finances, mentoring, and industry connections.  And at the end of the incubation period, the incubated entity will have the right to purchase the incubating entity‚Äôs interest in the incubated station.  The end result?  The incubator program would lead to greater diversity and competition in the broadcast industry. As I come home from Geneva, I‚Äôm as energized as ever to deliver the networks of the future for the benefit of all Americans.  With a lot on tap for our August meeting, on top of tomorrow‚Äôs open meeting (where we‚Äôll make progress on opening up mid-band spectrum and improving emergency alerts), a good summer is only getting better.

52	Scoring a Victory for 5G	Ajit Pai	2018-06-20 13:45:00	1529527500.0	The World Cup kicked off a week ago, and defending champion Germany‚Äôs upset loss in its opening match against Mexico reminded us that past victories do not guarantee future success.  The principle that we can‚Äôt afford to rest on our laurels applies to the FCC‚Äôs work as well.  Nowhere is this more evident than in our efforts to promote U.S. leadership in the next generation of wireless technology or 5G. The United States set the pace globally in the deployment of 4G LTE networks.  A key reason why was the Commission‚Äôs aggressive moves to free up spectrum for mobile broadband.  When it comes to 5G, we need to keep the playbook fresh and forward leaning.  So at our July meeting, the FCC will take another step to ensure that America continues to lead the world in mobile innovation. Our spectrum strategy calls for making low-band, mid-band, and high-band airwaves available for flexible use.  Over the past few months, we‚Äôve put that effort front and center.  In June, for example, we moved again on high-band spectrum: We finalized rules for use of the 24 GHz band, made progress on final rules for the lower 37 GHz band, and proposed to free up even more spectrum for flexible wireless use in both the 26 GHz and 42 GHz bands.  And in May, we launched a proceeding to allow more effective use of a wide swath of spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band.  Now, headlining the agenda at the FCC‚Äôs July meeting is a proposal to make more intensive use of mid-band spectrum from 3.7 to 4.2 GHz, commonly called the C-band.  Other countries are looking at this spectrum neighborhood as a prime resource for deploying 5G, and the United States is moving forward here as well.  In response to a Notice of Inquiry we initiated last summer, stakeholders have come up with a number of creative ideas for making better use of 3.7 to 4.2 GHz.  And next month, we‚Äôll vote on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that seeks more detailed feedback on those ideas that merit further exploration.  That Notice of Inquiry also sought comment on new uses in the 6 GHz band.  I‚Äôm pleased to say that we plan to move forward with a rulemaking on that spectrum this fall. Another area in which the FCC has made substantial progress but must not stand still is emergency alerting. The false missile alert issued in Hawaii earlier this year exposed problems with the Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alerts system. The Commission‚Äôs Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau launched an investigation to identify what went wrong in Hawaii and how to prevent or mitigate similar problems in the future. Building on the Bureau‚Äôs recommendations, we will vote on July 12 on an order and proposed rules designed to stop and correct false emergency alerts. The order would enable state and local officials to conduct more effective Emergency Alert System testing and public outreach, which can better prepare officials and their communities for actual emergencies. And the proposal would invite public input on specific ways to help guard against and address false emergency alerts and to help ensure the reliable delivery of wireless emergency alerts to subscribers‚Äô phones. The FCC‚Äôs work to review our policies and make updates and improvements where necessary is an ongoing, across-the-board effort. For instance, two months into my Chairmanship, the Commission voted to reform our rules governing commercial cellular service, which were first adopted in 1981. These changes enabled the use of 800 MHz Cellular spectrum for mobile broadband services, such as LTE.  At our July meeting, we‚Äôll follow up with further streamlining and modernization of our rules for that spectrum band and for certain other wireless licensees. Speaking of modernization, one of our biggest efforts to update the Commission‚Äôs rules has been our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative. In the latest action to come out of the MMRI, the FCC will begin to review our children‚Äôs programming rules.  These rules impose programming mandates on broadcast television stations (and only broadcast television stations).  Commissioner O‚ÄôRielly has developed a number of proposals for updating these regulations to better match today‚Äôs video marketplace.  As the father of two young children, I know firsthand that the way kids watch video programming these days is very different than when I was growing up.  But our children‚Äôs television rules haven‚Äôt kept up with the times. That‚Äôs why Commissioner O‚ÄôRielly is leading the effort to address this problem.  You can read more about his approach to this issue here and here. Another set of regulations hasn‚Äôt kept pace with technology: our rules regarding number portability. Giving consumers the power to keep their phone numbers when they switch carriers has been great for consumers and businesses alike. It‚Äôs also helped foster a competitive marketplace.  But while you can keep your number when changing service providers and moving locally, you can‚Äôt necessarily keep your number when you move farther away. Fixing this problem isn‚Äôt simple, but we‚Äôll vote on July 12 on preliminary steps to achieving nationwide number portability. These changes are pretty technical. Among other things, the FCC would give carriers greater flexibility in how they route calls and would forbear from applying outdated dialing parity rules to competitive carriers.  But they‚Äôre the first steps on the road toward the important destination of nationwide number portability. We‚Äôll have one final vote‚Äîthis one focused on improving our internal processes. On tap is an order that would create a uniform set of procedural rules for formal complaint proceedings administered by our Enforcement Bureau. This item would streamline and consolidate rules for processing complaints regarding pole attachments, disability access, and other topics. And as a good-government measure, we would apply a shot clock for Commission action on all formal complaints. This would ensure that these complaints are resolved in a reasonable amount of time. When the Commission convenes for its next meeting on July 12, four teams will remain in contention for the World Cup championship. We don‚Äôt know which four teams those will be, although we do know that the United States, unfortunately, won‚Äôt be one of them. But when it comes to 5G, it‚Äôs imperative that we remain at the front of the pack. That‚Äôs why the FCC is focused on winning the 5G future through smart spectrum and infrastructure policies and why we‚Äôll advance American leadership in 5G at our July meeting.

53	FCC Regulatory Free Arena	Michael O'Rielly	2018-06-01 11:15:00	1527876900.0	"As consequential as the FCC can be in communications policy, it is critical for those in leadership positions to acknowledge that its authority and reach is inherently limited. In fact, current law prevents the Commission from having any role or oversight over numerous modern technologies central to many Americans' communications habits. This universe is often called the app economy or gig environment, but we should also call it for what it really is: an FCC regulatory free arena. These services are capturing Americans' attention, and thus the market share and advertising dollars of legacy providers, on an astronomically fast pace with no letup in sight. Consider that a 2017 report suggests that the global app economy will triple in value (from $1.3 trillion to $6.3 trillion) and app use will double (from to 1.6 trillion hours to 3.5 trillion) by 2021. Additionally, an Interactive Advertising Bureau sponsored report from earlier this month shows online advertising surpassing television as the number one advertising platform and swamping the rest of the field. As such, it should be impossible for policymakers to ignore their immense popularity, the substitutability of services with those offered by Commission regulatees, and the disruptive force non-regulated services are having with regards to the Commission's activities. That is, the need for the Commission's regulatory structures (and therefore its relevance and function) are fading like that of a snowman in springtime or, more on point, like the steep decline of the traditional switched access voice telephone service. This rapid development and momentous shift of consumer preferences toward application-centric offerings, requires the Commission to evolve its overall approach. Entire subject areas ‚Äî once proud mainstays of the agency's workload ‚Äî need to be scrapped immediately. Why, for instance, should the Commission spend one more minute adjusting the wireline separations accounting rules? This is comparable to being located immediately adjacent to a thundering tornado and spending significant time debating which size umbrella to use. Likewise, the Commission must rethink outdated terminology and market definitions. Continuing to label and regulate certain providers as ""incumbents"" based on legacy notions of competition instead of marketplace realities makes no sense. A big fish may seem dominant in a small reef until a shark swims by. To put this discussion into stark perspective, the following provides a snapshot of several key communications services (and accompanying leading providers) that the Commission DOES NOT regulate. Maybe you've heard of these companies or used them once or twice recently? All over-the-top video offerings, including: All instant messaging and online chat offerings, including: All social media offerings, including: All music streaming offerings, including: All non-PSTN voice/video offerings, including: All Internet Cloud offerings, including: Congress has provided powerful tools in the form of forbearance and mandatory, periodic reviews that Chairman Pai and this Commission have rightly seized upon, but there is capacity to do more if entities would do the work to make the proper showings. Specifically, if an existing FCC regulatee is in the voice, video, or data business, they should be knocking down our doors to demand fundamental and colossal relief. And this opinion is not just mine. Talk with any market analyst or investor group, as I try to do regularly, on whether they see new large-scale investment coming to any services regulated by the Commission and, except for certain opportunities in the wireless sector, they will look at you like you have two heads and speak Venusian. Ultimately, the only logical take-away from this information is to either support greater deregulation of FCC regulatees that must compete with these services or advocate for new Congressional powers to regulate these services, which would seem futile and unnecessary. At a minimum, people should realize that the Commission's role is much narrower than they may have originally assumed.

54	Older Americans and Broadband: Getting Connected	Patrick Webre	2018-05-24 11:30:00	1527186600.0	At the FCC, we know first-hand the value of broadband access as a driver for economic opportunity, job creation, education and civic engagement. Under Chairman Pai, the FCC has committed to closing the digital divide between those who have access to cutting-edge communications services and those who do not‚Äîespecially those in unserved, oftentimes rural, areas. The FCC is also working to promote the benefits of broadband service among older Americans. While a recent Pew Research Center report shows significant growth in broadband adoption among Gen Xers and Baby Boomers, many older Americans remain on the sidelines of the digital revolution, lagging far behind the generations that have followed.   Why the lag? Conventional wisdom points to a generational technophobia, but we find that explanation somewhat simplistic.  An important factor is that seniors have not been a typical target demographic for early adoption and the lion‚Äôs share of product marketing remains focused on younger Americans. At the FCC, it‚Äôs our job to help inform all generations about the full range of benefits broadband can offer. As Chairman Pai stated recently in a speech to Project GOAL‚Äôs Conference on Aging and Technology: ‚ÄúGetting everyone connected could tremendously improve the lives of older adults. New technologies empower older Americans to live independently like never before.‚Äù As we mark Older Americans Month, the FCC‚Äôs Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau is increasing its outreach efforts to seniors, engaging with partners such as the American Library Association in a campaign to help older Americans ‚ÄúGet Connected‚Äù with: Loved ones, friends and family Life-saving telemedicine and telehealth Life-enhancing social engagement opportunities Online shopping featuring home delivery We are also launching a new ‚ÄúGet Connected‚Äù webpage with seniors in mind while including information relevant to all generations: fcc.gov/connected.  There you‚Äôll find answers to frequently asked questions about Getting Broadband, along with Household Broadband and Broadband Speed guides to help you determine what type of service suits you best. The Get Connected web page also links to additional FCC resources and information. Older Americans may also be particularly interested in Connect2Health, with assorted features focusing on healthy aging through telehealth and telemedicine. Broadband access is critical to those services.   If you‚Äôre reading this blog post and you‚Äôre an older American, then most likely you‚Äôve found value in broadband adoption and are enjoying its benefits. You can join us in helping your peers Get Connected to broadband as well by downloading this poster and sharing it with local libraries, senior centers and other community gathering spots.

55	Debunking the Sinclair Agenda Myth	Michael O'Rielly	2018-05-18 12:20:00	1526671200.0	This week, I had the opportunity to travel to Phoenix, Arizona to observe and check in on the progress of one of the ATSC 3.0 test markets. In Phoenix, twelve broadcast stations are participating in the test market, including Scripps Company‚Äôs KNXV Channel 15 (ABC), Fox Television Stations‚Äô KSAZ Channel 10 (FOX) and KUTP Channel 26 (MyTV Network), Meredith Local Media Group‚Äôs KPHO Channel 17 (CBS) and KTVK Channel 24 (Independent), Nexstar Media Group‚Äôs KASW Channel 49 (CW Network), Telemundo Station Group‚Äôs KTAZ Channel 39 (Telemundo), Tegna‚Äôs KPNX Channel 12 (NBC), Univision‚Äôs KFPH-CD Channel 35 (UniMas) and KTVW-DT Channel 33 (Univsion), Arizona Television KAZT Channel 7, and Arizona PBS KAET Channel 8. Together, these broadcasters ‚Äì along with cable and manufacturing partners ‚Äì are engaging in hyper-collaboration in order to deliver enhanced audio, emergency alerting, and other pro-consumer features to the market as quickly as possible.  Seeing this collaboration was impressive in and of itself, but it also emphasized what I already knew to be the case: that ATSC 3.0 may very well be a game changer for our nation‚Äôs broadcasters. Unfortunately, there is a false narrative in Washington, DC, that ATSC 3.0 will only benefit one particular company.  In fact, this narrative goes even further, suggesting everything the Commission has done in the media space over the last 17 months has been to benefit one company, in this case, Sinclair Broadcast Group.[1]  This misguided fantasy is perplexing to other broadcast stations across the country that have seen real benefits to our actions.  That is why I believe it is time to call these assertions for what they truly are: a rhetorical tool designed to divert attention from opponents‚Äô lack of substantive objections to the underlying policies, combined with what seemingly appears to be an extreme personal dislike for the company itself. It should be of no great surprise that this is occurring in the current D.C. environment, but for whatever reason, such violative charges have gone unchecked.  That‚Äôs not right.  Those spreading such false claims should be challenged to show ‚Äî with some form of detailed evidence ‚Äî a direct link between Commission action on media items and the alleged intent to directly benefit that one company (and, by the way, it cannot be done).  The American people deserve to know that decisions in these matters were based on the underlying law and corresponding record ‚Äî as required.  The Commission‚Äôs actions under Chairman Pai‚Äôs leadership have been designed to reduce the labyrinth of outdated and costly media rules that no longer make sense today.  This is vital in the current marketplace where television broadcasters are not competing solely amongst each other, but, also, with cable networks and major over-the-top platforms like Netflix and Amazon.     The following is an effort to examine each major media item approved by this Commission, which should help eliminate any notion of favoritism towards Sinclair: Main Studio Rule ‚Äî Fundamentally, it is perplexing that people have tried to malign Chairman Pai for this item when I was the one who championed the elimination of the main studio rule.  Thus, a person would have to believe in not only a hidden Sinclair agenda but also that there was some master conspiracy between the Chairman and me to get to that outcome.  Such a theory is Area 51 territory.  And no proof exists for this purpose since it didn‚Äôt happen. Substantively, although the elimination of the main studio rule applies to all broadcasters, it‚Äôs relief is most beneficial to small and mid-sized radio stations. For example, while in Phoenix I had the opportunity to tour a Univision station and meet with the general manager who explained how the elimination of the main studio rule will allow Univision to determine how to more efficiently allocate resources to its four radio stations in Arizona once it no longer has to pay for four separate offices. Univision has no plans to cut local news in those areas, but instead can now expand such reporting with their newfound resources. By all admissions, Sinclair is neither small nor all that interested in radio; it owns four radio stations today out of the 15,499 total licensed AM and FM stations, and hasn‚Äôt shown a desire to further invest in the medium. Moreover, just as I predicted, the elimination of the unnecessary rule hasn‚Äôt led to great studio consolidation or closures. Instead, it was and is about permitting cost efficiencies ‚Äî without harm to localism ‚Äî for all broadcasters, which will occur over a longer time frame. UHF Discount ‚Äî As I have stated on numerous occasions, the Commission didn‚Äôt have the authority to eliminate the UHF discount, as it did in 2016 because it was part of the larger compromise in Congress to set the national ownership cap at 39 percent.  When this Commission reinstated the discount, it was merely reverting back to the proper status quo and undoing the illegal actions of the previous Commission.  Thus, whether the discount is helpful for Sinclair is irrelevant, as we have the obligation to comply with what the law is, instead of what some people would like it to be.  Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership ‚Äî Sinclair owns no ‚Äúnewspapers‚Äù of the kind that are captured by the FCC‚Äôs prior prohibition and, like most broadcasters, has shown no interest in investing in the medium.  The elimination of the rule provides little to no benefit to the company.  Moreover, elimination of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership ban has been attempted by the FCC under different leadership in 2002 and 2006.  Unfortunately, previous efforts were stymied by the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals on procedural and unrelated grounds.  All to say, this has been a burden the Commission has been grappling with ‚Äì and trying to do away with ‚Äì for more than 15 years.  Radio/Television Cross-Ownership ‚Äî As mentioned, Sinclair owns four radio stations already permitted under Commission rules and like most television broadcasters has shown little interest in investing further in the medium.  The elimination of the rule provides little to no benefit to the company. Waiver of Duopolies of Top Four Stations in a Market ‚Äî The Commission‚Äôs 2017 reconsideration of the 2010/2014 Quadrennial debacle adopted a waiver process to allow duopolies in a market, even if both stations are among the top four in terms of audience share.  Anti-Sinclair activists argue that the Commission opened a special path to approve potential Sinclair duopolies.  For anyone who followed my views, they would know that I favored greater relief than just a waiver process, which can be completely subjective and abused (see previous Commissions).  Given the limited procedures available under reconsideration, I was willing to delay a larger examination until the 2018 Quadrennial.  Accordingly, the Commission will likely be able to holistically examine our top four duopoly policy later this year.  And, this was not a position I recently developed.  In August 2016, I admonished the Commission for not addressing this issue then.  Specifically, I stated: ‚ÄúTo say [the duopoly rule] is still needed in an era of literally hundreds of competitive pay TV channels and essentially unlimited competitive Internet content defies belief.‚Äù  My position has not changed, and I will continue to work to ensure that in our next review we adequately define the media marketplace to reflect this reality.  In the meantime, I have no doubt that Chairman Pai will run a transparent waiver process open for all applicants ‚Äî not targeted for Sinclair.   National Ownership Cap ‚Äî I have been abundantly clear that I don‚Äôt believe the Commission has been authorized by Congress via statute to change the so-called national ownership cap.  Ironically, my position aligns with the view previously expressed by Sinclair, which has since changed.  While the Commission has teed-up an NPRM on the subject and may eventually adopt a new level or modify the formula for its calculation, such an action will likely be challenged in court.  Because I am supportive of getting to court review, I will back changes to the existing cap, which I don‚Äôt think is substantively defensible any longer.  Despite lending my support to get to court review, I suspect my words and position will be used to undermine the Commission‚Äôs future case.  Accordingly, it should be impossible for anyone to suggest with a straight face that this item represents some pro-Sinclair agenda. Television JSA Attribution Rule ‚Äî Joint Sales Agreements (JSAs), the practice of one station selling ad spots for another in exchange for a portion of the proceeds, are legal, legitimate, and proper ways to generate efficiencies for local broadcasters, especially for smaller ones that may not have the capacity or the expertise to run a full ad shop.  Trying to attribute ownership to the larger station for JSAs was a backdoor mechanism to cease JSAs and ignored the reality that JSAs likely would be less necessary if the Commission, with court approval, removed or further relaxed its byzantine media ownership rules.  This notwithstanding, Congress recently spoke to this issue requiring the Commission to delay its attribution rules and include transferability for all existing JSAs until September 30, 2025.  Thus, the Commission‚Äôs elimination of its attribution rule in 2017 had little practical effect, including for Sinclair.         Sinclair Enforcement Action ‚Äî In a recent Notice of Apparent Liability issued against Sinclair, the Commission proposed a record fine of $13.4 million for failing to include required sponsorship identifications for broadcast station advertisements.  In doing so, the Commission rejected mitigating factors, such as the ads were for a legitimate cancer institute, that could have justified reducing the fine.  Notwithstanding, critics argue that Sinclair was let off easy as the fine could have been higher.  And yet, the fine matched our existing precedent.  That is, we took the base forfeiture amount, multiplied it by the number of violating ads, and then adjusted it upwards to an even higher level.  To ignore precedent by imposing a higher fine would significantly increase the likelihood that the courts would overturn the decision.  Overall, it‚Äôs hard to fathom that the strong proposed enforcement action against Sinclair, in this case, can be viewed as favoritism.    ATSC 3.0 Standard ‚Äî As outlined above, critics have argued that the Commission‚Äôs actions to adopt a new television standard was done to aid Sinclair‚Äôs profitability via its portfolio of patents that it holds applicable to the new standard.  Anyone who followed the Commission‚Äôs deliberations regarding ATSC 3.0 would know that I advocated against including any portion of the standards in our rules.  Instead, I made the case that we should have just eliminated rules prohibiting broadcasters from moving to ATSC 3.0.  Moreover, it should be noted that the adoption of a compilation of twenty standards making up ATSC 3.0 by the private sector went through extensive debate and voting procedures.  The Commission merely adopted what the standard setting body agreed to.  It is also noteworthy to emphasize that ATSC 3.0, as designed by this Commission, will be a voluntary, consumer-driven transition.  The new standard promises real benefits for consumers ‚Äì such as ultra-high definition pictures and enhanced emergency alerting.  But, if consumers are uninterested in these features, they will not be forced to adopt them.  Again, while in Phoenix, I got to witness twelve broadcast stations ‚Äì none of which were Sinclair ‚Äì collaborate on how best to launch ATSC 3.0 in the Arizona test market based on focus groups and studies showing what consumers most responded to.  Typically, outside of today‚Äôs anti-Sinclair doctrine, this would be considered a major victory for the consumer.   Broadcast Incubator Program ‚Äî The creation of an incubator program, being led by Chairman Pai, is intended to increase broadcast ownership by small entities, often including women and minority groups.  While the program is likely to need some type of benefit to entice participation, the end goal is to further diversify ownership, thereby decreasing larger station group ownership, such as that by Sinclair.  Yet, desperate to see this Commission‚Äôs media ownership reforms struck down or remanded by the Third Circuit, advocacy groups have actually opposed this program.  It may be more prudent to question their agenda, not mine.      *             *             * Examining each of the items above should show to the unprejudiced reader that the action either didn‚Äôt help Sinclair in any capacity or was done to relieve the entire broadcast industry of a burden.  Any benefit to Sinclair was residual and non-intentional.  At the same time, the entire debate misses the bigger picture that I witnessed firsthand in Arizona this week: that the changing marketplace is causing tremendous challenges to legacy broadcasters forced to abide by outdated and irrelevant ownership limitations and Commission rules.  My priority has been to remove these outdated burdens imposed by the Commission that no longer serve the public interest or make sense, so that broadcasters are able to survive and thrive in the current competitive landscape.  I will continue down this path as long as I have the privilege to serve as a Commissioner of this agency.         [1] I maintain a strict policy of not commenting on any pending or prospective transaction.  Correcting the record here does not violate that position as it does not attempt to engage in any discussion involving Sinclair‚Äôs pending merger application.

56	A Summer Blockbuster Open Meeting	Ajit Pai	2018-05-16 13:33:00	1526502780.0	In the spirit of the summer blockbuster season, the Commission‚Äôs June 7 meeting is going to be our own version of ‚ÄúAvengers: Infinity War.‚Äù  We‚Äôre taking familiar headliners‚Äîfreeing up spectrum, removing barriers to infrastructure buildout, expanding satellite services, modernizing outdated rules, eliminating waste, improving accessibility, protecting consumers‚Äîand rolling them into one, super-sized meeting.  Fittingly, our featured order is a sequel of its own.  For the past few years, one of the agency‚Äôs highest priorities has been repurposing high-band spectrum for next-generation wireless services like 5G.  In 2016, the FCC unanimously adopted the Spectrum Frontiers Order, which established rules for wireless broadband operations in frequencies at or above 24 GHz.  Last year, we approved the Second Report and Order, which modified the 2016 rules and made available an additional 1,700 megahertz of wireless spectrum for flexible use in the 24 GHz and 47 GHz bands.  Today, I‚Äôm circulating a Third Report and Order and Further Notice that takes the next steps necessary to promote U.S. leadership in 5G and to deliver advanced wireless services to American consumers. My plan contains multiple proposals for multiple bands, so I‚Äôll tick through them quickly.  First, it would establish performance requirements for IoT networks, revise our mobile spectrum holdings rules, and resolve pending sharing and operability issues in the 24 GHz band.  Second, for the lower 37 GHz band, we would resolve pending petitions for reconsideration and establish a band plan.  Third, the Further Notice asks further questions about the sharing framework for federal and non-federal use in the 37 GHz band.  Fourth, it also proposes making spectrum in both the 26 GHz and 42 GHz bands available for flexible wireless use.  There‚Äôs a lot to digest here, but the big takeaway is that the FCC is taking action to unleash spectrum for the next-generation wireless services that will help grow our economy, boost our nation‚Äôs competitiveness, and improve our quality of life.  As I said at the outset, our June meeting features the Commission‚Äôs greatest hits.  Removing regulatory barriers to encourage the deployment of next-generation networks and close the digital divide certainly fits that bill.  That‚Äôs something that consumers strongly support; as I‚Äôve traveled from the Mountain West to the Gulf Coast, I‚Äôve heard many of them say that they want to benefit from modern, more resilient technologies like optical fiber instead of limping along with slower services like DSL provided over old, often-degraded copper.  To respond to that desire, I‚Äôve shared an order with my colleagues that would make it easier for companies to discontinue outdated, legacy services and transition to the networks of the future.  These reforms would enable the private sector to stop spending scarce dollars propping up fading technologies of the past and promote investment in technologies of the future.  They will also make it easier to restore service in the aftermath of natural disasters and other catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Another key to closing the digital divide is lowering the cost of broadband services for consumers.  Unfortunately, the FCC‚Äôs current rules impose disparate financial burdens on certain rural broadband providers, and their customers literally wind up paying the price.  Bear with me on this:  The FCC has consistently declined to impose Universal Service Fund (USF) contributions obligations on broadband Internet access service.  In English, that essentially means we don‚Äôt tax broadband.  But rural carriers that offer certain broadband transmission services are uniquely required to contribute to the USF on the revenues from those offerings.  Again in English, this essentially means rural companies (hence their customers) have to pay broadband taxes that others don‚Äôt have to pay.  On June 7, we‚Äôll vote on an order that would relieve small, rural carriers from having to pay these broadband taxes, thereby reducing the cost of broadband services for their customers. Since 2017, the FCC has placed greater emphasis on enabling new satellite technologies to help close the digital divide.  In particular, we‚Äôve looked to the skies and have approved the first non-geostationary satellite orbit satellites that would enable high-speed Internet access comparable to Earth-bound offerings.  Our June agenda includes two items that would allow satellite companies to offer new services in the United States.  The first would expand the U.S. market access of O3b Limited, allowing it to use 26 additional satellites to supply broadband to American customers.  The second authorizes Audacy Corporation, a California-based startup, to deploy a middle-Earth-orbit satellite constellation that enables satellite systems to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to each other.   Our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative has been a consistent source of content for Commission meetings, and our June meeting will be no different.  This time, we tackle the FCC‚Äôs leased access rules.  These rules require cable operators to set aside channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated video programmers.  The glaring problem with our leased access rules is that they‚Äôve been in legal limbo for a decade.  The Commission updated them in 2008, but the Office of Management and Budget never approved them and a federal court halted them.  All this means that the 2008 update never went into effect and businesses are still operating under rules adopted nearly 25 years ago.  I‚Äôve proposed to vacate the 2008 Order and start over with a clean slate regarding our leased access rules‚Äîincluding an examination of how to modernize them to fit the modern marketplace.   We‚Äôll also be reviewing our rules to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.  Historically, our intercarrier compensation system has in many cases enabled arbitrage as a business model.  In 2011, the FCC adopted reforms to the ICC system that curbed some abuses.  But there are still too many loopholes that allow bad actors to game the system.  This June, the Commission will consider two items that eye further reform of the intercarrier compensation system.   The first is an Notice of Proposed Rulemaking looking at how to eliminate incentives to artificially inflate call volumes and to inefficiently route calls.  The second focuses on getting rid of incentives for bad actors to abuse the toll-free system (known as 8YY), such as by flooding 8YY numbers with robocalls for the purpose of racking up originating access charges.  Speaking of toll-free numbers, we‚Äôll also consider in June how to make sure that the texting capabilities of toll-free numbers aren‚Äôt hijacked by unauthorized parties.  Toll-free numbers are a popular tool used by businesses and government to be more open and accessible to the public.  And increasingly, these toll-free numbers are used by businesses for text communications.  This can be a valuable and innovative use of toll-free numbers.  But to make sure third parties that don‚Äôt abuse the system by ‚Äútext-enabling‚Äù a toll-free number they don‚Äôt own, we want to set rules of the road for activating this function. Another valuable and innovative service that we‚Äôll be addressing at our June meeting is Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS).  This is a telecommunications service (technically, a telecommunications relay service, or TRS) that allows individuals with hearing loss to both read captions and use their residual hearing to understand a telephone conversation.  Use of IP CTS is paid for entirely through the FCC‚Äôs TRS Fund, and it‚Äôs grown exponentially in recent years.  Today, this service represents almost 80% of the total minutes compensated out of the Commission TRS Fund‚Äîat a cost of nearly one billion dollars.  At the same time, the contribution base for the TRS Fund is shrinking.  We simply have to take action to preserve the viability of IP CTS for those people with hearing loss who need it.  That‚Äôs why we‚Äôll be voting on moving IP CTS compensation rates closer to actual provider costs, on measures to limit unnecessary IP CTS use, and on exploring ways to expand the TRS Fund contribution base.  The order would also allow service providers to use fully-automated speech recognition to generate captions and bring the benefits of this innovation to IP CTS users. We not only want to expand access to technologies and services that help consumers, we want to shield them from illegal and harmful practices.  Two longstanding and continuing problems for consumers are slamming and cramming.  Slamming is the unauthorized change of a consumer‚Äôs preferred telecommunications provider.  Cramming is the placement of unauthorized charges on a consumer‚Äôs telephone bill.  The FCC has taken enforcement actions against slamming and cramming for several years, but the rules against these types of fraud need to be strengthened.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proposing new rules that include a clear ban on misrepresentations made during sales calls and a clean prohibition against placing unauthorized charges on consumers‚Äô phone bills.  My proposal would also put additional teeth into our anti-slamming rules by clarifying that carriers who abuse our third-party verification process will be suspended from using that system for two years. Rounding out our June meeting will be an enforcement item, which I can‚Äôt currently disclose.  Think of it as the surprise teaser at the conclusion of every Marvel movie. Like ‚ÄúInfinity War,‚Äù our June meeting will have a running time that many may find excessive.  But it also stands to unleash billions in economic activity and include multiple crowd-pleasers that I hope will leave the audience wanting more.

57	On the Road Again	Ajit Pai	2018-04-18 13:55:00	1524084900.0	Earlier this month, I completed the latest leg of my ongoing digital divide tour, logging over 500 miles in a rental car across Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas.  Yet again, I heard stories about how broadband connectivity can bring new opportunities and services just about anywhere.  In Scottsville, Kentucky, a town of 4,000 that‚Äôs nearly 30 miles from the nearest pediatrician, I visited a school where telemedicine allows sick students to be treated by doctors at Vanderbilt University‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital in Nashville.  The next day, I attended a roundtable in Franklin, Tennessee, where I heard from local leaders about how access to high-speed broadband is necessary for economic growth in rural areas.   The FCC has been hard at work doing what we can to help close the digital divide.  Last month, the application window closed for our first-of-its-kind Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction, which will distribute nearly $2 billion to expand fixed broadband deployment in rural America.  The reverse auction will begin on July 24.  Last month, we also took a significant leap forward in streamlining our wireless infrastructure rules, which is projected to cut deployment costs by up to $1.56 billion by 2026.  But we‚Äôre always looking to do more. One way we can expand connectivity is promoting more efficient and productive use of underused spectrum.  Earlier this week, the FCC kicked off the process for auctioning the 28 GHz and 24 GHz bands, which will get previously underused high-band spectrum into the hands of those champing at the bit to deploy next-generation wireless broadband services, commonly known as 5G.   This month, we tackle mid-band spectrum in the 2.5 GHz range.  Significant portions of the Educational Broadband Service (EBS) spectrum in this band currently lie fallow across approximately one-half of the United States, mostly in rural areas.  And we haven‚Äôt granted new access to the entire 114 MHz of spectrum in this band for over 20 years.  In other words, a scarce public resource that could be used to connect millions of Americans for a long time hasn‚Äôt been put to the best use, if it‚Äôs even been used at all.  At a time when we are seeking to lead the world in 5G and connect every American with digital opportunity, that‚Äôs not acceptable.  We can‚Äôt afford to leave this large band of spectrum behind. That‚Äôs why we will vote at our May 10 meeting on a proposal to allow more efficient and effective use of this band.  Specifically, I‚Äôm proposing provide greater flexibility to current EBS licensees to freely use and transfer their spectrum.  We would consider new opportunities for educational entities and Tribal Nations to gain access to this spectrum in places where they have a local presence and can best serve their communities.  And we would open up the remaining 2.5 GHz spectrum for auction to anyone, including commercial entities, on a flexible-use basis. I barely had time to recover from my three-state trip through the Mid-South before I found myself on a plane to Las Vegas to join America‚Äôs broadcasters for their biggest annual convention.  Among other things, I spoke of my commitment to modernizing our media rules to match the marketplace and technology of today.   One year ago, I launched our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, a comprehensive review of our media regulations.  The aim was to identify rules that needed to be updated or repealed altogether.  We‚Äôve already started nine separate rulemakings as a result of this effort; today, I‚Äôm proposing number ten. Currently, the FCC has rules that require broadcasters to physically display or maintain their licenses and related information in specific locations.  But now, most of this information is available through the Commission‚Äôs electronic databases.  As with cable channel lineups and hardcopies of the FCC‚Äôs rules (each of which we‚Äôve addressed previously), these rules seem redundant and obsolete.  So I‚Äôll ask Commissioners to consider streamlining or eliminating them altogether. Additionally, at our May meeting, the FCC will consider ways to mitigate any interference caused by the expanded use of FM translators.  The goal is to simplify and expedite the interference complaint process, which would benefit both full-power FM radio stations and FM translators.  Among other things, my proposal: (1) would allow translator stations to resolve interference by moving to any available same-band channel using a minor modification application; and (2) would require a minimum number of legitimate complaints to support any interference claim.   Our May agenda will also include a Hearing Designation Order and an enforcement item.  I wish I could share details of these, but each of them has to remain confidential until the meeting.   There‚Äôs one final, bittersweet observation about the May meeting I feel compelled to make.  The FCC‚Äôs May 2017 meeting will be the first since 2009 where Commissioner Mignon Clyburn will not be casting votes.  She announced yesterday that her time at the FCC will come to a close before May 10.  I want to take this opportunity to once again salute Commissioner Clyburn on her public service.  She has been a tremendous leader, including as the first woman to head the agency, and she has shown steadfast resolve on issues as varied as telehealth, media diversity, and digital inclusion.  I‚Äôve enjoyed working with her and, even when we have not seen eye-to-eye on policy, I‚Äôve always held her candor and thoughtfulness in the highest regard.  She‚Äôs been a wonderful colleague and friend.  I wish her the best as she heads out toward the open road. And the road is where I‚Äôll close, too.  One of the great joys of my job is having the privilege of meeting people from all across the country and hearing their stories.  These interactions inform our work and inspire me to keep pushing ahead.  I‚Äôm grateful that, yet again, the FCC is taking our lessons from around the country and translating them into action.  And in the words of the inimitable Willie Nelson, I just can‚Äôt wait to get on the road again and learn more from the American people.

58	Expo Showcases Solutions to Stop Illegal Robocalls	Patrick Webre	2018-04-16 17:35:00	1523925300.0	"One thing we hear regularly at the FCC is, ""What can be done about robocalls?"" And each day, we discuss ways that we can help reduce this scourge. One of these ways is the work we do with the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC. In March we teamed up with the FTC for a Joint Policy Forum on robocalls, which included expert panels addressing challenges facing consumers, industry and regulators, along with solutions and tools for consumers (see video). The technology solutions included those still in development, along with many call-blocking resources that are available to consumers today. Some of these tools and solutions will be on display at our next event for consumers: the FCC-FTC Stop Illegal Robocalls Expo. Exhibitors will include major telecom service providers as well as app developers and other innovators focused on blocking illegal robocalls, texts, and caller ID spoofing. The event is open to the public and is set for 10 a.m. to noon EDT on April 23, in the Pepco Edison Place Gallery at 702 8th St NW, Washington, D.C. The Expo is designed to raise consumer awareness of call-blocking technologies and to provide a venue for technologists and service providers to showcase solutions for filtering unwanted calls, which not only annoy, but oftentimes seek to defraud, consumers. Meanwhile, the FCC continues to develop new policy solutions, creating effective new rules and working with service providers to help them stem the tide of illegal robocalls and texts. We are also taking strong enforcement actions against illegal robocallers. We partner in these efforts with the FTC, sharing information to go after bad actors. In addition, we are engaged with consumers directly, and we encourage consumers to file complaints with us about illegal robocalls they receive. When you file a complaint with the FCC, you may be alerting us to new scams that are just surfacing. Your complaint may also help us track the bad actors who use phone networks and technology to spoof numbers and commit fraud and identity theft.

59	Experienced Advice for New Broadband Program	Michael O'Rielly	2018-04-11 15:15:00	1523484900.0	Over the years, I have spent a considerable amount of my time at the Commission focused on improving broadband deployment, particularly in rural and remote parts of the nation that have no access or remain on slow dial-up service.  In these communities, where there is little to no business case to extend broadband, the FCC‚Äôs federal universal service fund (USF) programs can make connecting consumers and local businesses possible.  Indeed, as the Commission has steadily reformed its USF programs to bring forward market efficiencies and stretch spending further, it has generally prioritized its annual $4.5 billion high-cost fund to these unserved communities, where new access to broadband can be the key to attracting and retaining residents and companies.  These efforts are already bearing fruit, and millions more unserved Americans will have the opportunity to obtain broadband service over the next 10 years.  More work must be done, however, to reach the farthest and most costly areas of our nation.  With the recent passage and enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), Congress made available $600 million for additional broadband deployment, particularly targeted at America‚Äôs rural areas.  This funding is to be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Rural Utilities Service (RUS) in the form of a pilot program.  Overall, the new program could be instrumental to filling coverage gaps in rural America not yet addressed by private companies and the FCC‚Äôs USF programs ‚Äì but only if it is implemented in a thoughtful and coordinated manner.   Fortunately, Congress directed that the funding be used for projects in predominately unserved areas.  Specifically, the law states that ‚Äúat least 90 percent of the households to be served by a project receiving a loan or grant under the pilot program shall be in a rural area without access to broadband, defined for this pilot program as 10 Mbps downstream, and 1 Mbps upstream.‚Äù  These qualifications should help avoid the pitfalls of prior stimulus funding efforts, where the insertion of new dollars, in some instances, were spent on duplicative construction rather than maximizing coverage across truly unserved areas.  The new statute also includes an important protection against overbuilding other RUS program participants.  In addition, for this program to be truly successful and help as many Americans as possible without service today, it is imperative that RUS coordinate with the FCC to ensure the implementation of regulations prevent any overbuilding of USF funding recipients.  By working in a complementary fashion, these programs can help providers extend and sustain broadband into the most rural parts of the nation.  For instance, the FCC has lacked the funding and resources to complete its Remote Areas Fund (RAF) proceeding, which was intended to bring service to the hardest to reach portions of the United States.  If the RUS pilot program can reach into these RAF or RAF-like areas, then the country will be much closer to achieving the objectives of universal service.  Without careful planning, however, valuable funding could be wasted duplicating service, distorting competition, and undermining the viability of existing and ongoing efforts to extend broadband.  Coordination is particularly important given key differences between the programs.  Unlike traditional grant programs, USF funding is distributed over a longer timeframe.  Additionally, while USF recipients are required to meet deployment milestones and report new broadband service, they have some flexibility on which areas are built out and when within the overall timeline.  Therefore, parts of a USF recipient‚Äôs service territory that appears to be unserved today should not be considered unserved if they are required to be built-out within a specified timeframe.  These are precisely the types of areas that RUS should be on the lookout to avoid overbuilding.  Similarly, the projects selected by RUS should prevent cherry-picking and a hollowing out of the economic epicenters of small communities, leaving another program, such as USF, to pick up the surrounding portions at much greater costs.    It is equally important for the FCC to understand how the RUS pilot program funding is being spent.  There are several programs that promote and enable broadband deployment and operation within the high-cost or Connect America Fund umbrella.  Some programs are already underway; some are about to commence in the form of upcoming auctions, and some have yet to be implemented.  Just as I hope that RUS will not duplicate the work of the FCC, I also want to ensure that we have the necessary data to ensure that a recipient of USF support from the FCC does not overbuild a different company receiving funding from the RUS pilot program. Along those lines, it will be important for both agencies to work with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on data on current and future broadband funding commitments so that the broadband map developed pursuant to this legislation provides the most accurate information possible regarding any remaining unserved areas.   *             *             * By sharing information and data on our respective programs, the FCC and RUS can provide valuable insight into which areas should receive support, helping to target funding in a cost-effective manner to places that need it most.  I hope that RUS will take advantage of this opportunity, and I stand ready to assist in any way.

60	No Spring Break for the FCC	Ajit Pai	2018-03-26 13:30:00	1522096200.0	The FCC‚Äôs first purpose, as set forth in the first section of our founding statute back in 1934, is to make communications available to all the people of the United States. Hardly a surprise. What might surprise people is that our second stated purpose is ‚Äúthe national defense.‚Äù  It was clear over 80 years ago that the reliability and resiliency of our communications networks were national security issues. The importance of securing those networks is even clearer today, in an age when they‚Äôve become the indispensable infrastructure of our modern economy. The changing communications landscape has not only elevated the importance of network security, but also created new challenges. One such challenge is the integrity of the supply chain‚Äîthat is, the process by which products and services are manufactured, distributed, sold, and ultimately integrated into networks. Over the past decade, the Executive Branch and Congress have repeatedly stressed the importance of identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities in communications networks and their supply chains. Of particular concern are the national security threats that certain communications equipment providers pose. On December 20, 2017, for example, a group of 18 Senators and Representatives wrote to me expressing their continued concern about the national security risks posed by certain Chinese communications equipment providers. (My response here.) The FCC does not have the authority or capacity to solve this problem alone. But we do have a role to play in addressing these concerns. For example, we have a responsibility to make sure that the money from our Universal Service Fund (USF) programs is not used in a way that undermines our national security. That‚Äôs why the Commission will be voting in April on a targeted proposal to prohibit the use of USF dollars to purchase equipment or services from any company that poses a national security threat to the integrity of U.S. communications networks or the communications supply chain.  But as number-one ranked Virginia reminded us in its historic first-round loss to UMBC in this year‚Äôs NCAA tournament, it‚Äôs not enough just to be great at defense. So while the Commission is working to secure our networks, we are simultaneously going on offense to upgrade our networks and ensure American leadership in 5G. Building on our progress last week modernizing our wireless infrastructure rules so that they are 5G ready, the Commission in April will continue to move full steam ahead in making spectrum available for next-generation 5G networks. In February, at this year‚Äôs Mobile World Congress, I announced that the FCC intends to hold an auction beginning this November of spectrum in the 28 GHz band, followed immediately thereafter by an auction of spectrum in the 24 GHz band.  To meet that timeline, we need to move quickly. And because legislation signed last Friday by the President has fixed a technical problem involving upfront payments by auction bidders for spectrum, we are now able to do just that. At our April meeting, the Commission will vote on a public notice seeking input on auction procedures for the 28 GHz and 24 GHz bands. And under the draft that I have presented my colleagues, the 28 GHz auction would commence on November 14. By kicking off the pre-auction processes, we take another important step to promote American innovation in 5G wireless services, the Internet of Things, and other advanced spectrum-based services at previously underused high-band frequencies. But our focus on the future isn‚Äôt limited to wireless; we also want to advance next-generation satellite technologies. Smaller, less expensive satellites with short-duration missions‚Äîoften known as ‚Äúsmall satellites‚Äù‚Äîare being developed and launched into space in increasing numbers.  More satellites mean more regulatory reviews.  Hence the problem: our current regulations weren‚Äôt designed with these smaller satellites in mind. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proposing to streamline the process for authorizing commercial small satellite operations. Under this proposal, if satellites or systems have certain characteristics, such as short orbital lifetimes, they could choose to file under a new, alternative small-satellite process. This process would be less burdensome in some respects, while still addressing important issues such as using spectrum efficiently and limiting orbital debris (if you saw Gravity, you know what I‚Äôm talking about). Back to Earth. This April, we‚Äôll also take the next step toward ensuring that phone calls to all Americans go through, including those in rural America. That isn‚Äôt always the case; too often, calls aren‚Äôt completed or drop for no reason, particularly inconveniencing rural consumers and businesses. To address this problem, I‚Äôm seeking to enact new rules to improve the monitoring by long-distance carriers of ‚Äúintermediate providers‚Äù to which calls are handed off. The goal is to ensure that carriers that are handed a call ‚Äî those who take the baton, so to speak ‚Äî don‚Äôt drop it, but instead take care to ensure it gets to its destination. At the same time, my proposal would free carriers from burdensome FCC reporting requirements because those rules haven‚Äôt produced reports that are useful to the agency. In addition, Congress recently enacted the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017. We‚Äôll work diligently to implement this new law, including by seeking public input on certain aspects of rural call completion, and continue to take other measures ‚Äúto ensure the integrity of voice communications and to prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such communications‚Äù (as the new law instructs). The next item on our April agenda is ‚Äî well, admittedly a little arcane, but hear me out. It would provide a path for rate-of-return carriers that receive high-cost universal service support under the Alternative Connect America Cost Model to voluntarily elect to migrate their business data services offerings to incentive regulation. Easy enough, right? In a nutshell, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking recognizes the fact that incentive regulation ‚Äî that is, rules that set broad goals and reward a company for being productive and efficient in meeting those goals, as opposed to rules (like rate-of-return rules) that simply tell a company what its allowable costs and return on investment will be ‚Äî promotes better investment decisions and consumer welfare. Incentive regulation also minimizes the administrative burdens of regulation for everyone; companies don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of hours and money on expensive cost studies, and the FCC doesn‚Äôt have to spend a lot of hours and money verifying those studies. The bottom line is that incentive regulation will allow carriers to spend scarce resources on things that more directly benefit consumers ‚Äî say, investing in better, stronger networks ‚Äî instead of paperwork to satisfy archaic rules. Rounding out our April meeting agenda are two matters connected to our ongoing Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative. First, we‚Äôll consider a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes to eliminate the requirement that cable operators maintain at their local offices a current listing of the cable television channels that each cable system delivers to its subscribers. Most people probably aren‚Äôt even aware of this, but cable companies are required to keep such listings in hardcopy thanks to an FCC regulation passed way back in 1972. Talk about outdated; channel listings are a quick Internet search away, making absurd the notion of a trip to the company office for the answer. Second, we‚Äôll vote on an order that would relax a requirement that TV stations must report annually to the FCC about the revenues they receive from ancillary and supplemental services. Astute observers will note that we teed up this proposal a few months ago. If adopted, broadcasters without any such revenues would no longer need to file a report with the Commission. Taking this step would eliminate unnecessary paperwork and is simple common sense; that might explain why the record reveals no opposition at all to this proposal. This week, with a lot of schools adjourning for spring break, I hope that many of you are on vacation (and that you watched justice be served as Kansas beat Duke). But when you return in April, you‚Äôll find the FCC hard at work during another busy month.	{0: {'username': 'Brett Glass', 'date_epoch': 1522727640.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-04-02 20:54:00', 'response_content': 'Chairman Pai:'}, 1: {'username': 'DLF World School Greater Noida', 'date_epoch': 1522232880.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-03-28 03:28:00', 'response_content': 'the blog you have shared is nice and useful Manoj Sharma really appreciate the same kindly keep writing the same.'}}
61	In the Aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Resilience and Challenges in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands	Ajit Pai	2018-03-19 12:30:00	1521487800.0	"Rebuilding the bridge in rural part of Utuado. Nearly six months have passed since Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the immediate aftermath of the storms, communications networks were virtually wiped out. More than 95% of cell sites were out in Puerto Rico and 77% of cell sites were out in the Virgin Islands. Progress is no doubt being made, with 4.4% and 13.8% of cell sites now out in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, respectively. But there's still much work to do, as too many still lack connectivity and basic infrastructure. More compelling than any statistic are the stories I heard on the ground. Earlier this month, along with members of the FCC's Hurricane Task Force, I visited Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Following up on my visit to Puerto Rico last year, I wanted to get a firsthand assessment of the recovery and rebuilding efforts, and to hear from residents who shared countless examples of resiliency and inspiration.  Chairman Pai met with Liberty crews working to restore service outside Utuado. In Puerto Rico, we traveled to Utuado, a rural, interior municipio (equivalent to a county) in the west-central part of the island. It was among the places hardest-hit by Hurricane Maria. We toured the ""camp of the forgotten"" in the Rio Arecibo neighborhood, and met Marilyn (pictured left), who recounted her daunting experience. During the storm, a local bridge washed away, leaving 1,600 residents stranded on the other side. The flooding was so substantial, and the water in the river so contaminated, that they had no other option but to ferry people from one side to the other. How? They put together a makeshift zipline, which included a chair that could carry one person at a time. The zipline was the community's only way to get out. To me, it brought home how brave and creative people can be in a time of need. (Marilyn, by the way, is now in charge of part of the rebuilding project. She has a tremendous spirit and is a force of nature!)  Center: utility pole snapped by Hurricane Maria. Right: Bamboo poles serve as makeshift solution to hold up communications lines. Left: newly-installed pole. Another major problem in Puerto Rico is that the wired infrastructure has been completely destroyed. Replacing it is hard and expensive. We saw that for ourselves during a visit to a fiber restoration project in another part of west-central Puerto Rico. Just off a rough road dotted with homes, we saw one utility pole that was snapped by powerful winds. That pole used to hold the wires that gave residents telephone and Internet access. Some cable lines were lying on the ground. We saw a few others being held up by slender bamboo stalks‚Äîwaiting to be transferred to replacement poles. Crews are now in the process of restringing cables and putting them back up on sturdy, new poles. The Liberty crew pictured here is mapping its work using a detailed map in the bed of a pickup. It costs more than $22,000 per mile to put the poles up and restring the fiber, but it's important work that has to be done to get service back up and running for residents.  Tanya-Marie Singh, CEO of U.S. Virgin Islands public television station WTJX. It isn't just telecom providers who were affected; broadcasters have suffered, too. In that regard, check out the picture to the left. If a picture is worth a thousand words, this one speaks a tome about the devastation in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Wires everywhere, ceiling falling down, and debris and ruined equipment all over. (See more pictures.) This was the scene at WTJX-TV. WTJX is a public television station located in St. Thomas. Chief Executive Officer Tanya-Marie Singh showed us what was once, and hopefully will again soon be, the studio of an important broadcaster on the island. She plans to rebuild the station after the current hurricane season in a way that enables WTJX to withstand future storms and keep residents informed during future emergencies. (We saw similar resolve in Puerto Rico; I met numerous radio and TV broadcasters during my time there, including an on-air appearance at WKAQ radio. Stories were common about station management and staff living in-studio for days during the storms.)  U.S. Virgin Islands public television station WTJX. Another part of our trip was meeting with government leaders. We had the opportunity to sit down with the governors of both islands‚ÄîGovernor Ricardo Rossell√≥ in Puerto Rico and Governor Kenneth Mapp in the U.S. Virgin Islands‚Äîto discuss rebuilding and restoration efforts. I briefed each of them on my proposal for the FCC to create two new funds‚Äîthe Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund (Bringing Puerto Rico Together Fund) and the Connect USVI Fund‚Äîthat together would provide almost $1 billion in funding for restoring and expanding communications networks.  With Ricardo Rossell√≥, Governor of Puerto Rico. We heard many perspectives on communications-related recovery efforts during a roundtable organized by U.S. Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n in San Juan; it included representatives of the Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, among many others.  With Kenneth Mapp, Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. We also participated in a very productive meeting of the Hurricane Integration Team (HIT) in the Virgin Islands. The HIT was set up to establish direct coordination among federal partners (particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency), the private sector, and Virgin Islands officials to restore communications services. Speaking of FEMA, we sat down with FEMA staff along with the head of the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Authority to discuss where things stood. We also enjoyed getting together with the Chairman and Commissioners of the U.S. Virgin Islands Public Services Commission to discuss our shared goal of a full and prompt recovery. Finally, we visited 911 call centers in both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where we heard about some of the challenges emergency responders had fielding calls and dispatching help to residents.  With Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n, Congresswoman for Puerto Rico. There's much to do in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to recover from last year's hurricane season, but residents are incredibly strong and resilient. We felt that spirit during the meetings described above, as well as visits to two schools, two hospitals, a police station, and more. The FCC will continue to stand side by side with them throughout the recovery and restoration process. This year's hurricane season is fast approaching (it officially starts on June 1). But especially if the FCC adopts my proposal to set up the Uniendo a Puerto Rico and Connect USVI Funds, I'm confident that our joint perseverance will prevail. I'm heartened and inspired by the people of the territories. My Hurricane Recovery Task Force colleagues and I thank them, both for hosting us and for educating us on the first-hand the effects of the devastating storms. We'll take back the lessons we learned to the FCC and do all we can to help people get back on their feet.

62	Winning the Wireless Future	Ajit Pai	2018-03-01 13:45:00	1519937100.0	Earlier this week, I was in Barcelona for the mobile industry‚Äôs largest global showcase.  The possibilities of our wireless future were on full display, with 5G‚Äîthe next generation of wireless service‚Äîthe hot topic.  The race to 5G is a global one, with countries in Asia and Europe particularly keen to seize the advantage. In a speech, I made clear that I want the United States to win that race.  I outlined the FCC‚Äôs strategy for 5G leadership and delivering next-generation wireless connectivity to American consumers using a three-part approach: forward-thinking spectrum policy, modernized rules for infrastructure deployment, and light-touch network regulation. This week, we‚Äôre putting that strategy to work, rolling out multiple actions to advance this agenda.  On Monday in Barcelona, I announced my plan for the FCC to hold an auction starting this November of spectrum in the 28 GHz band.  We‚Äôll follow up immediately thereafter with an auction of spectrum in the 24 GHz band. This high-band spectrum will be critical to the rollout of 5G, because it will enable extremely fast connections with more capacity. There‚Äôs no telling how innovators might use this spectrum‚Äîit could be high-bandwidth applications like virtual reality and/or low-bandwidth ones like industrial Internet-of-Things monitoring‚Äîbut experience teaches us that consumers ultimately will be big winners. On Tuesday, we unveiled a map of the initial areas eligible for federal subsidies from the FCC‚Äôs Mobility Fund Phase II.  As you might remember, last year, we rolled out a plan to devote up to $4.53 billion over the next decade to bring 4G LTE service to areas of the country that don‚Äôt yet have it. The new map begins the process of determining which specific areas those are.  It‚Äôs an important step toward holding the MF II reverse auction, in which we‚Äôll allocate that money.  And today, I‚Äôm unveiling a lineup for the FCC‚Äôs March 22 open meeting that builds on this momentum. Headlining the meeting will be a vital part of our 5G strategy: modernizing our rules to promote the wireless infrastructure of the future.  One thing we know about 5G wireless networks is that they‚Äôll be infrastructure-intensive.  Instead of a 200-foot cell tower, we‚Äôll see hundreds of small cells, installed more inconspicuously, operating at lower power, and delivering much faster speeds.  Some analysts project that 5G will involve a 100-fold increase in the number of small cells deployed in the United States.  But there‚Äôs a snag: many of the FCC‚Äôs rules are still designed for cell towers.  The hoops set up by these regulations are a mismatch for 5G infrastructure and are holding back the construction of next-generation networks.  That‚Äôs why I asked my colleague, Commissioner Brendan Carr, to lead the FCC‚Äôs effort to modernize our wireless infrastructure rules.  Thanks to his efforts, we‚Äôll be voting on an order at our March meeting that would do just that.  Most importantly, it would find that the private sector‚Äôs deployment of certain small wireless facilities shouldn‚Äôt trigger federal historic preservation and environmental reviews.  Red tape like this is not only unnecessary for small cells, but also increases the cost and slows down the deployment of wireless networks.  To circle back to the theme I opened with, it was clear in Barcelona that countries around the world are striving to lead the world in 5G.  We‚Äôve led the world in wireless for some time now, but it‚Äôs not a given that we‚Äôll do so again.  If the United States is going to be at the front of the pack in 5G, we need to have the right rules in place to expedite the deployment of 5G networks.  All the 5G spectrum we free up won‚Äôt matter if the networks to carry wireless traffic don‚Äôt exist.  And so, as Commissioner Carr has put it, we need to be 5G Ready.  This makes the March 22 vote to update our wireless infrastructure rules very important. One specific area where we are seeking to spur effective use of spectrum and leverage wireless technologies is the 4.9 GHz band. Way back in 2002, the FCC designated 50 MHz of contiguous spectrum in that band for public safety use. Unfortunately, this spectrum has never been used as much as had been hoped.  So a few years ago, the FCC explored ways to stimulate expanded use of and investment in this band. Based on the feedback we received from the public safety community, we‚Äôve developed new proposals to promote greater public safety use of the 4.9 GHz band and incentivize investment in new technologies. The FCC will be voting on these proposals at our March meeting.      We‚Äôll also vote on a second public safety matter at our March meeting. This one tackles the important issue of ‚Äúmisrouted‚Äù 911 calls from wireless phones.  Every 911 call center I visit these days‚Äîand I‚Äôve visited many, in big cities and small towns‚Äîreports that a strong majority of the emergency calls they get come from wireless phones.  Currently, wireless 911 calls are routed to 911 call centers based on the location of the tower that handles the call.  But when calls are made near a county or city border, the nearest cell tower may be in a neighboring jurisdiction, so you end up with 911 calls being answered by emergency call-takers who have to transfer the call to first responders in another jurisdiction.  The scope of this problem became apparent to me during a recent visit to the Washington, DC Office of Unified Communications (OUC). There, Director Karima Holmes told me the OUC received about 10,000 misrouted 911 calls last year, which had to be transferred to Maryland authorities (and many thousands of calls received in Maryland were transferred into the District). Every second counts in an emergency, so these delays can have a huge impact. The good news is that technology now can help route calls to the correct call center without the need for a transfer.  I‚Äôm therefore asking my fellow commissioners to join me in launching an inquiry to figure out how widespread a problem this is and how we can ensure that 911 calls are routed based on the location of the caller as opposed to the location of the cell tower that handles that call.  Overly restrictive regulations not only stifle the private sector; they also ultimately hurt consumers.  That‚Äôs been the case with signal boosters, which are basically devices that improve wireless coverage by amplifying wireless signals.  To be sure, the FCC‚Äôs 2013 rules authorizing the use of signal boosters have been a net positive for consumers by allowing them to get better coverage in areas where signals are weak, such as in their basement or on their commute through rural areas.  But the current rules unnecessarily restrict these boosters to personal use, preventing small businesses and other organizations from taking advantage of these devices.  Given credible evidence that boosters will not cause interference under existing safeguards, the FCC will vote on March 22 on eliminating the personal use restriction and allowing boosters to be used in business settings for the benefit of employees or the general public.  In addition, the FCC will seek public input on ways to increase the availability of signal boosters.  Proposals we‚Äôre considering include expanding the spectrum bands in which boosters may operate and making it easier to embed boosters in vehicles.  Our goal is pretty simple: to give consumers who want better wireless coverage more options for getting it.    As we‚Äôre unleashing the benefits of communications technologies, we also want to minimize the downsides. And judging from consumers‚Äô complaints to the FCC, the biggest frustration related to modern communications is unwanted robocalls. The Commission has engaged in an aggressive, multi-front battle against these constant irritants, and one of the fronts in this war is the issue of unwanted calls to reassigned numbers. When you disconnect your phone number and get a new one, you probably don‚Äôt notify everyone who has called you in the past, including businesses (like pharmacies or electric utilities) to whom you‚Äôve given permission to call. So when your old phone number is reassigned to someone else, the new subscriber starts getting calls that were meant for you. This not only annoys the new number-holder, but can also subject the callers to liability.  At this month‚Äôs open meeting, the FCC will vote on finding ways to tackle this reassigned numbers problem. Among other ideas, we‚Äôll explore the creation of a single database that callers could use to check and see if phone numbers have been reassigned.  The last item on our March agenda will be the latest reform to come out of our media modernization initiative.  When broadcast television entities come to the FCC hoping to assign or transfer a satellite station in the context of a transaction, that station‚Äôs status as a ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù must be reauthorized.  Such reauthorization traditionally requires the broadcast entity to make the same rigorous showing that was required initially when the station was formally designated a satellite by the Commission.  Some folks have argued that requiring the same evidentiary showing for a reauthorization request is unnecessarily costly and burdensome in many cases, both for the applicants and the Commission; everyone knows the duck still quacks like a duck, so to speak, so the current process is wasteful.  In three weeks, we‚Äôll vote on a proposal to streamline the process for reauthorizing satellite stations when they are assigned or transferred.  But returning to where I started, the main focus of our March meeting will be on wireless issues. Whether we‚Äôre ensuring that America can lead the world in 5G, allowing for more productive use of spectrum for public safety, or giving consumers better wireless coverage, our goal is to maximize the benefits of wireless technologies for the American people.

63	A New Tool To Help Close the Digital Divide	Steve Rosenberg	2018-03-01 11:45:00	1519929900.0	Chairman Pai has said that bridging the digital divide is his highest priority. And now, we have a valuable tool that will aid in efforts to bridge the gap: a new interactive broadband map, which will help the public and policy-makers understand where there are gaps in delivering fixed broadband and much more.  Available now at https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov,  the map will allow people to learn more about broadband in their areas, and across the country.  This new map is built on the latest data for fixed-broadband deployment, collected every six months by the FCC from providers on Form 477.  Right now, that‚Äôs data as of December 2016, but the new map is designed to be quickly and easily updated with the most recent data sets. Essentially a web application that includes a variety of maps and other features, this map builds on what we learned from the legacy National Broadband Map and the maps we‚Äôve published since then at FCC Maps.  It‚Äôs designed from the start to be flexible.  Instead of one or two possible combinations of technology and speed, this map allows users to choose from 441 combinations.  That‚Äôs not a typo‚Äîchoose from between one and six technologies in any combination, and from among seven speeds‚Äîit really is 441 combinations.  The app also marries maps and additional data together on a page, providing graphs and tables to put the maps in context and help people make sense of them. So how can you use the map? As with the legacy National Broadband Map, consumers can enter an address, either at the home page, or on the Location Summary tab, and have the map show them the area and display a list of providers reporting service¬≠‚Äîa full list of providers regardless of which of those 441 combination you‚Äôve chosen. Policymakers are often interested in the bigger picture.  They can get detail about a particular area on the Area Summary tab, whether they‚Äôre interested in the entire country, a state, a county, a Congressional District, a city or town (Census Place), a tribal area, or a statistical area (CBSA).  Simply choose the type of area, start typing and select the area of interest.   The app provides a map of the area along with three graphs that show what fraction of the population has, or lacks, the kind of broadband selected.   Policymakers can also compare one area with another on the Area Comparison tab. We think the way all these things come together is what makes this new map such a step forward.  Do you want to research the availability of 100 Mpbs or even 1 Gbps broadband instead of 25 Mbps service?  You can get a coverage map and graphs in a few clicks to better understand coverage.   Do you want to focus only on fiber to the premises?  The new map makes it easy to see just how much of the country has fiber‚Äîand, importantly, how much lacks fiber coverage.  Interested instead in high-speed alternatives to the cable and telecom companies?   The new map lets you pick the technologies and speeds you care about.  Or perhaps, you‚Äôre worried that rural or tribal areas are being left behind.  The map provides easy comparisons in a couple of mouse clicks, whatever combination of technology and speed interest you. It means that rather than saying there‚Äôs only one or two ways to look at broadband, as we‚Äôve done in the past, the new map puts the power in your hands to determine what kind of broadband matters to you‚Äîand it makes maps and graphs of what you want easily accessible. The map can do a lot more and we encourage you to watch the short demonstration video and go play with the map to see for yourself. We will continue to add features to the map over time too.  So please check it out whenever you have a question arise about fixed broadband deployment.  We would love to hear how you are using the map and welcome any feedback about ways to improve the site. You can reach us at maps@fcc.gov. And remember that we continue to publish maps about mobile broadband deployment and many other topics at https://www.fcc.gov/maps.  Beyond mapping, this page provides at least some sense of all the work the FCC is doing to help bring high-speed Internet access to all Americans.	{0: {'username': 'Somvir Singh', 'date_epoch': 1627108200.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-07-23 23:30:00', 'response_content': 'Join Indian Army Recruitment, Online Registration, Admit Cards, Rally Schedule, Rally Results & Online Form 2021-22'}, 1: {'username': 'meri padhai', 'date_epoch': 1559114220.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-05-29 00:17:00', 'response_content': 'iit jam coaching in delhi'}, 2: {'username': 'april ceria', 'date_epoch': 1548194220.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-01-22 14:57:00', 'response_content': 'Klinik Aborsi Jakarta adalah Tempat Aborsi Aman , Legal & Steril'}, 3: {'username': 'Online games', 'date_epoch': 1521921840.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-03-24 13:04:00', 'response_content': 'That is great, I love wireless and kizi.space games, thanks article bookmarked.'}, 4: {'username': 'Bert K', 'date_epoch': 1520265060.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-03-05 08:51:00', 'response_content': 'Keep in mind, though, that it‚Äôs based on Form 477 data submitted by ISPs.

64	Abusing Section 1	Michael O'Rielly	2018-02-21 16:05:00	1519254300.0	While most former FCC Chairmen tend to take a step away for a little bit after they depart the Commission, former Chair Tom Wheeler is far from traditional.  Generally, I have ignored the former Chairman‚Äôs musings, despite their inaccuracies and overall misguided perspective.  In recent weeks, however, Wheeler has pontificated about the current Commission‚Äôs lack of action on the issue of Internet network security.  At the risk of engaging, I find it necessary to call out the gibberish in his recent writings.  In essence, Wheeler‚Äôs views reaffirm that he is unwilling to read the law and follow basic principles of statutory construction. In complete fairness, Wheeler is correct to state that I firmly believe that current law provides the Commission with little authority over Internet security.  He‚Äôs right when he recently wrote that ‚ÄúCommissioner O‚ÄôReilly (sic) described the FCC‚Äôs cyber authority as ‚Äòextremely limited.‚Äô‚Äù  I have written about, given speeches, testified before Congress, and spoken publicly on that exact point.  Instead, Wheeler takes issue with my and others analysis of the law.  Therefore, the debate is focused on a straight interpretation of the statute, not whether the Commission should have such authority or what it could do if it had such power.  While he dabbles with other arguments, Wheeler‚Äôs central case centers on Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 as providing some universal authority over all communications activity, especially cybersecurity.  To be clear, he doesn‚Äôt even seem to imply that Section 1 is ancillary authority, but rather direct authority delegated by Congress.  For those unfamiliar, the text of Section 1 is as follows: For the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges, for the purpose of the national defense, for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communications, and for the purpose of securing a more effective execution of this policy by centralizing authority heretofore granted by law to several agencies and by granting additional authority with respect to interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication, there is created a commission to be known as the ‚ÄúFederal Communications Commission‚Äù, which shall be constituted as hereinafter provided, and which shall execute and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Specifically, Wheeler uses the language ‚Äúfor the purpose of the national defense, for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communications,‚Ä¶‚Äù to suggest that the Commission has direct authority over cybersecurity/Internet networks and whatever else is related.  In particular, he argues, ‚ÄúThat mandate to deal with threats to national defense and public safety surely encompasses the current cyber threats to national and individual security.‚Äù There are a multitude of problems with this reading, including: Massive Scope Interpretation ‚Äî If Section 1 is as expansive as the former Chairman suggests, then it effectively means the Commission‚Äôs scope of authority over ‚Äúcommunication by wire or radio‚Äù is without bounds. Electronic securities transactions?  Autonomous vehicle information? Fake tweets or Facebook postings intended to influence an election?  In fact, it is hard to fathom any communications activity ‚Äî including every aspect of the Internet, thus all Internet application providers and routing systems ‚Äî that wouldn‚Äôt be subject to the Commission‚Äôs reaches under the guise of national defense and/or promoting safety of life and property.  Yet, even Wheeler acknowledged in the past that the Commission doesn‚Äôt oversee so-called edge providers.  Was he wrong then or now?  No Independent Authority ‚Äî The plain reading of Section 1 clearly shows that the relevant beginning serves as a preamble to justify the creation of the FCC.  It‚Äôs title ‚Äì ‚ÄúPurposes of Chapter‚Äù ‚Äì helps demonstrate that the section explains why the Commission was created.  It sets the stage for Congress moving away from the Federal Radio Commission and to the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Commission.  In fact, almost everyone else remotely involved in communications policy has acknowledged Section 1 as a policy statement, not actual authority. As such, the section does not provide the Commission with independent authority to do anything. Just think about the ramifications if it did.Why have fights over the reach of Section 201 or Title VI, for instance, if Section 1 provides unlimited authority to do everything imaginable?Why would there ever be a discussion over the ancillary authority of Section 4(i) if Section 1 is supreme authority?A Wheeler-interpreted Section 1 would be omnipotent and eviscerate the need for any of the remaining provisions, which is not what Congress ever intended, and not how courts construe statutes.[1] Rejection by the Court ‚Äî You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it that these assertions are baseless.  In Comcast v FCC (2010), the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals completely undermines Wheeler‚Äôs contention, by accepting the Commission‚Äôs admission that Section 1 is a policy statement and then ruling, ‚ÄúPolicy statements are just that ‚Äî statements of policy.  They are not delegations of regulatory authority.‚Äù[2]  And, even if Wheeler tried to take the ancillary route, the court shot that down as well by finding, ‚Äúthe Commission cites neither section 230(b) nor [s]ection 1 to shed light on any express statutory delegation of authority found in Title II, III, VI, or, for that matter, anywhere else.‚Äù[3]  Thus, Wheeler would have had to cite a statutory provision in which Section 1 would be ancillary, which doesn‚Äôt exist to achieve his policy goal.  In terms of any ‚Äúmandate‚Äù to act, the same court ‚Äî just four months ago ‚Äî rejected Wheeler‚Äôs Section 1 view that there is some mandate to take action.Specifically, in MMTC v FCC, the court declared that ‚ÄúSection 1 by its terms does not impose an affirmative obligation on the FCC to take any particular action.‚Äù[4]  The Homeland Security Department‚Äôs Job ‚Äî Cybersecurity is certainly and rightly a policy area that requires a significant amount of attention.  Accordingly, it seems that everyone wants to be involved.  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on this very topic last year, finding that duplicative cyber regulations imposed by various federal agencies have taken industry‚Äôs attention away from securing their networks and towards a compliance, check-the-box regime.[5]  That is why Congress assigned responsibility over these issues to the Department of Homeland Security.  It is detrimental for any agency or department to try to wedge itself into an area overseen by another.  To argue that the Commission try to stretch its authority beyond what Congress asked of it and interfere where its assistance hasn‚Äôt been requested is outrageous.  Throwing more governmental agencies at a problem is not a solution to a perplexing policy matter.  Moreover, if Wheeler thinks that the Homeland Security Department is not doing its job, he should take that up with Congress, instead of trying to drag the FCC into the issue. *             *             * I‚Äôll go about fulfilling my obligations at the Commission under the limits and boundaries that Congress established, even if that means missing out on the chance to get our mittens in the middle of cybersecurity.  However, if Congress passes a statute providing the Commission with authority over this issue, I will fully implement any new authority given the Commission.

65	Innovation Month at the FCC	Ajit Pai	2018-02-01 13:45:00	1517517900.0	Tomorrow is Groundhog Day.  Fittingly, I‚Äôm announcing an agenda for the Commission‚Äôs February meeting that revisits some familiar themes from the past year: modernizing outdated rules, closing the digital divide, and most significantly, promoting innovation. Topping the agenda for Innovation Month will be a proposal to unleash new wireless services and technologies in frequencies above 95 GHz.  Traditionally, these airwaves haven‚Äôt been viewed as well-suited for communications services.  But recent advancements in propagation technology have changed the equation and expanded the boundary of usable spectrum.  As a result, these very high-band frequencies are today‚Äôs spectrum horizons. In 2016, the Commission sought public comment on new possible uses for spectrum above 95 GHz.  American innovators responded with a wide array of suggestions, ranging from fixed wireless service to backhaul for 5G systems to Wi-Fi-like unlicensed applications to next-generation satellite services. The time has come to let go of the reins with respect to these very high bands and start empowering U.S. innovators to test their ideas.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve circulated my Spectrum Horizons proposal to open up this spectrum and create a new testbed for technological progress. Specifically, I‚Äôm seeking input on whether to make available up to 102 gigahertz of spectrum for licensed use, two-thirds of which would be shared with satellite services. (Just to give you a sense of how much spectrum that is, most spectrum currently in use for common commercial services‚Äîeverything from AM radio to Wi-Fi‚Äîtakes up less than 6 gigahertz total, although we continue to push the bounds higher.) I‚Äôm also asking whether we should allocate 15.2 gigahertz of spectrum for unlicensed use in four different bands. Finally, in the spirit of ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know until you try,‚Äù I‚Äôm proposing to add a new type of experimental license that would permit experimental use in any frequency from 95 GHz to 3 THz and would provide more flexibility for license holders.  Now, I recognize that most of this spectrum is currently shared between federal government agencies and non-federal users, so this plan would continue close coordination with the executive branch.  If this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is approved at our February meeting, I hope to get good public feedback on these ideas and then act quickly.  If we broaden our nation‚Äôs spectrum horizons, we‚Äôll keep the United States in the lead when it comes to technological innovation. Unleashing spectrum is just one part of the Commission‚Äôs pro-innovation strategy.  Another is streamlining the Commission‚Äôs processes. Entrepreneurs are constantly developing new technologies and services.  But too often, they‚Äôre unable to bring them quickly to market for consumers because regulatory inertia stands in the way.  Unfortunately, the FCC can suffer from this government-wide problem.   The FCC should facilitate, rather than frustrate, innovation.  Accordingly, early in my Chairmanship, I declared that the Commission would adhere to Section 7 of the Communications Act.  Section 7 instructs the Commission to respond to petitions or applications proposing new technologies and services within one year.  The provision was established by Congress in 1983, but it‚Äôs long been ignored‚Äîin fact, the FCC has not established any guidelines or rules in 35 years and has never embraced the statutory mandate of section 7!  At our February meeting, we‚Äôll vote on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that ultimately aims to codify Section 7‚Äôs commitment to prompt action in the Commission‚Äôs rules.  Establishing clear guidelines and procedures for Section 7 implementation would ensure that new technologies and services are identified early in the process, and that the FCC takes timely action where approval of these new technologies or services would serve the public interest.  Bottom line: government shouldn‚Äôt be a bottleneck for entrepreneurs looking to design a better mousetrap. In addition to these pro-innovation proposals, the FCC is set to take another step forward in our work to close the digital divide.  Last year, the Commission created a plan to invest $4.5 billion over the next 10 years to expand 4G LTE service to areas that don‚Äôt have it.  The Commission then received petitions for reconsideration for certain aspects of that Mobility Fund II Report & Order.  In three weeks, the Commission will vote on an item to resolve those aspects of the petitions that haven‚Äôt yet been addressed.  Resolving these questions would move us closer to the start of the Mobility Fund II reverse auction, and eventually the end of dead spots in rural America where wireless coverage simply isn‚Äôt available. Our February agenda is rounded out by three items that aim to remove outdated and unnecessary regulations.  Two of these are products of the Commission‚Äôs Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative. FCC rules require Commission staff to conduct a mid-term review of certain broadcast stations‚Äô equal employment opportunity (EEO) practices around the midpoint of broadcasters‚Äô eight-year license terms.To help facilitate such a review, the Commission currently requires these broadcast stations to submit a form providing certain information that, with one exception, is also available in stations‚Äô online public files. But in the digital era, it doesn‚Äôt make much sense to require someone to file what you can already access online.  I‚Äôm therefore asking my colleagues to consider eliminating this filing requirement, while simultaneously maintaining the mid-term review Next, as some may recall, the first rulemaking to come out of our initiative to modernize our media rules was a proposal to eliminate the rule requiring certain broadcast and cable entities to maintain paper copies of the Commission‚Äôs regulations.  We received unanimous support for this proposal, given that this information is now available and easily accessible online (if you‚Äôre seeing a trend here‚Äîbing!).  So today, I‚Äôm sharing an Order that would eliminate this outdated and unnecessary requirement. Rounding out our February agenda will be a Report and Order to eliminate the annual audit and associated reporting requirement for payphone service providers.  As fewer and fewer people use payphones, compliance with these rules now costs carriers a large fraction of, if not more than, the total compensation the audits are meant to verify (you read that correctly).  This Order would also eliminate interim and intermediate per-payphone compensation rules that no longer apply to any entity. In February, the Commission is yet again taking concrete action to unleash innovation, close the digital divide, and modernize our rules.  And regardless of whether Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow tomorrow, we‚Äôll keep returning to these themes time and again so long as I have the privilege of leading this agency.

66	Paper FCC Record: Why in the World?	Michael O'Rielly	2018-02-02 10:30:00	1517592600.0	While not ranking highest on the list of significant process reforms needed, the practice of printing hard-copies of the ‚ÄúFCC Record‚Äù should be eliminated.  To be crystal clear, I am not suggesting that we keep its contents or information from the public.  On the contrary, I suggest that it makes little sense to continue to publish paper copies when other mechanisms are more consumer friendly, cost-efficient, and easier to access.  Instead, the Commission should make its documents centrally located and easier to find for interested parties electronically, making paper copies of the Record unnecessary on a going forward basis.  If Encyclopedia Britannica could eliminate paper versions of their works in 2012, why can‚Äôt the FCC do the same for its paper copies in 2018?  For those unfamiliar, the FCC Record contains ‚Äúa comprehensive compilation of decisions, reports, public notices and other documents of the Federal Communications Commission of the United States.‚Äù  These voluminous books are printed at government expense by the Government Printing Office‚Äôs (GPO) contractor and offered to the public on a subscription basis from the GPO for a yearly fee of approximately $813, or each issue can be purchased separately for $65.  Take the 2016 version (which is the last full year available): it amounted to 17 volumes with 14,129 pages.  You can see for yourself here: Paper copies are truly unnecessary in 2018.  In fact, there are already multiple ways to access the same information.  Initially, consumers can obtain each individual document that comprises the Record on the Commission‚Äôs website (see for example http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1219/DA-17-1219A1.pdf).  Additionally, certain Federal and state depository libraries, such as the University of North Texas, maintain electronic copies of the FCC Record volumes as part of its collection.  Moreover, commercial computer databases (e.g., Thompson Reuters‚Äô Westlaw and Lexis/Nexis) provide searchable and printable copies of FCC Record items for a subscription.  More importantly, the Commission already posts a PDF version of each item reflecting its FCC Record number ‚Äì to the extent that is of assistance ‚Äì via an ECFS Advanced Search (see for example https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-17-1127A1_Rcd.pdf and https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-17-12A1_Rcd.pdf).        Further, the Commission ‚Äì on its own accord ‚Äì certainly has the capability to publish the FCC Record electronically as a PDF on our website.  In fact, the Commission compiles the current FCC Record, not the GPO or its contractor.  Specifically, the FCC takes its documents from EDOCs, creates the volume, sets the FCC record pages, and then supplies a PDF version to the printer.  In 2016 and 2017, the FCC then purchased 80 printed copies of the FCC Record.  The FCC, however, could just as easily compile the PDF and just put it online, saving the costs of purchasing paper copies for its own use.  To aid in consumer functionality, the Commission could also establish a separate webpage that consisted of only PDF Record compilations.  Ultimately, replacing paper copies of the FCC Record with an electronic version would save scarce federal funding, be more accessible for interested parties, and result in less paper waste.  That seems worth the limited effort needed to make it a reality.

67	It‚Äôs Time to Reexamine the FCC‚Äôs Kid Vid Requirements	Michael O'Rielly	2018-01-26 10:30:00	1516987800.0	In the last quarter of 2017, the Commission thoughtfully teed up several, smaller-scale Notice of Proposed Rulemakings to eliminate or modify outdated media regulations.  While clearing the regulatory underbrush is incredibly important and a high priority for me, it is also time for the Commission to move forward on some of the bigger ideas proposed in the record.  In particular, I posit that the Commission needs to reconsider the ineffective and burdensome requirements currently imposed on our nation‚Äôs broadcasters to air a certain amount of educational and informational children‚Äôs programming on a weekly basis, colloquially referred to as Kid Vid. Background & FCC Actions In 1990, the Children‚Äôs Television Act (CTA) became law, despite former President George H.W. Bush‚Äôs objections (though not his veto).  This very short legislation required broadcasters to serve the educational and informational needs of children in its overall programming and imposed commercial limitations during such programming.  In 1991, the Commission‚Äôs implementing rules required ‚Äúbroadcasters to air some amount of standard-length educational and informational programming specifically designed for children 16 years of age and under.‚Äù[1]  No minimum requirement of programming hours was imposed. This decision was responsive to ‚Äústrong legislative direction,‚Äù[2] where Members of Congress involved in its passage clearly stated that they did not intend for the CTA to require a quantitative program mandate.  Former Senator Inouye (D-HI), for example, explained, ‚ÄúThe Committee does not intend that the FCC interpret this legislation as requiring or mandating quantification standards governing the amount or placement of children‚Äôs educational and informational [programming] that a broadcast licensee must air to pass a license renewal review pursuant to this legislation.‚Äù[3]  And, then-Congressman Markey (D-MA) affirmed ‚ÄúThe legislation does not require the FCC to set quantitative guidelines for educational programming, but instead requires the Commission to base its [renewal] decision upon an evaluation of a station‚Äôs overall service to children.‚Äù[4] Had the Commission heeded these statements, there likely would not be a need for this blog.  But, by 1996, some within Congress evolved their positions.  In May, then-Congressman Markey, along with 219 other Members of Congress, sent a letter to the Commission calling on the FCC to adopt its proposed rule ‚Äúspecify[ing] a minimum amount [of children‚Äôs programming] necessary‚Äù such as ‚Äú3 hours per week‚Äù in order ‚Äúto guarantee renewal of a broadcast license.‚Äù[5]  Responsively, in August of 1996, the FCC ratcheted up its Kid Vid rules, requiring broadcasters to air an average of three hours per week over a six month time period of children‚Äôs ‚Äúcore‚Äù programming or face challenges with getting their licenses renewed.[6]  Such programming ‚Äúmust have serving the educational and informational needs of children as a significant purpose,‚Äù air between 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., run at least 30 minutes, and be regularly scheduled at least weekly.[7]  To top it off, broadcasters are required to specify in writing the objective of the program and the target child audience, as well as provide programming information in the form of on-air identifications, program guides, and include in their public file quarterly reports the exact programs they aired in the previous quarter and the programming they plan to air in the next quarter.    Further changes were made in 2004 that increased the Kid Vid burdens even more.  These included expanding to digital television multicast channels additional core programming ‚Äúroughly proportional to the additional amount of free video programming‚Äù an individual station chose to make available[8] and capping the amount of permitted preemption of core programming for other programs (such as breaking news or live sports).  The order also expanded various commercial limitations to core programming, including bans on website displays and host selling.  Not surprisingly, these changes proved so extensive that the Commission had to return to the subject in 2006 to undo parts of them and to modify others. Since 2006, the FCC has considered a host of additional Kid Vid obligations, including mandatory weekday coverage and placing a greater emphasis on fulfilling children‚Äôs ‚Äúcognitive/intellectual‚Äù needs as opposed to their ‚Äúsocial/emotional‚Äù needs.  Further action on these initiatives have stalled, but somehow are allowed to continue to linger in the record.  Great Children‚Äôs Programming Exists Elsewhere Before the hysteria erupts, let me be clear: as a parent of a toddler, I believe children‚Äôs television programming, both entertainment and educational, can be beneficial to a child‚Äôs development, if done in moderation.  True story: I think my daughter‚Äôs first words were Ma Ma, Da Da and Elmo . . . And I am not sure that they were spoken in that order.  But that‚Äôs the point.  Our family consumes a fair share of children-centric programming ‚Äì whether its Daniel Tiger‚Äôs Neighborhood, Peppa Pig, or Thomas the Tank Engine ‚Äì but none of these shows are aired on commercial broadcast stations.  In fact, I can‚Äôt think of the last time, if ever, we turned to a local broadcast television station for children‚Äôs programming. And, we are not the exception to the rule.  I recently met with PBS, who described all the interactive programming it has launched, including its 24/7 PBS Kids multicast subchannel.  PBS expects around 100 licensees will launch this channel, covering 90 percent of U.S. TV households.  While Kid Vid rules (minus the reporting requirements) apply to noncommercial educational stations like PBS, such programming is tied to the mission of these stations and PBS does not need a mandate to continue providing such content.  In fact, children‚Äôs programming on PBS is only expected to increase and hopefully be enhanced with the proliferation of the new ATSC 3.0 broadcast standard the Commission recently approved.  For example, PBS is exploring ways of enforcing positive program messages by having children play targeted games after tuning in to a particular television show.  Not only is this more advanced than what is being done on commercial broadcast television stations, but it also reaches the vast majority of Americans, eliminating the argument that over-the-air-only households miss out.  For the lion‚Äôs share of Americans, cable networks also provide a host of children‚Äôs programming options for a variety of age groups, including Disney Junior, Nick Jr., Nickelodeon, and Universal Kids.  These stations air linear programming all day and often have strong on-demand programming available as well.  As Nexstar Broadcasting recently pointed out, ‚ÄúChildren increasingly view media content ‚Äòon demand‚Äô‚Äîwhether the content is pre-recorded on a digital video recorder, available through an MVPD VOD service, or on mobile phones, tablets, and other portable devices.‚Äù Additionally, there is a host of children‚Äôs programs available from popular over-the-top providers, such as Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, or subscription services, such as HBO, many of which have specifically targeted children‚Äôs programming as a way to gain market share and consumer acceptance.  In fact, in August HBO reached a five-year carriage deal with Sesame Street to not only carry more new content each season, but also a Muppets spinoff.  Moreover, studies show that children ages 8 to 18 already spend a significant amount of time consuming video content on YouTube and other online platforms.[9]  And, it appears that Facebook plans to offer video content targeted to teenagers in the coming months.[10] The appropriate question, therefore, is not whether children‚Äôs programming is available.  The question that must be asked is where is the market failure to warrant the continuation of the FCC‚Äôs Kid Vid mandates?  Based on the above, it is hard to conclude anything other than the market for children‚Äôs programming is booming.  Negative Impact of Current Rules With today‚Äôs dynamic media marketplace there are very little, if any, additional benefits provided by the Kid Vid rules.  Not only are they unnecessary, but after over two decades of experience with the 1996 enhanced regulations, there is scant evidence to indicate that children‚Äôs programming on broadcast stations has improved.  There is also no scientific proof that the Kid Vid requirements specifically have led to developmental benefits for children.  Meanwhile, the current mandates have real world consequences.   Here are a few examples of the costs Kid Vid imposes: Preempts More Desired or Valuable Local Programming ‚Äî Some will likely try to argue that Kid Vid concerns are overblown, as 3 hours per week out of the 105 core programming hours available is not burdensome, or such an obligation is a small price to pay for the right to hold a broadcast license, i.e., a public interest requirement.  But such thinking ignores two important realities.  First, there are a finite number of hours of audience viewing, forcing broadcasters to face the tough choice of airing programming that audiences want or following the stringent requirements of Kid Vid that the FCC has mandated.  In fact, once a local broadcast affiliate subtracts network requirements and newscasts, there is not much free time for other programming, meaning Kid Vid programming generally gets relegated to Saturday mornings.  But, today, Saturdays‚Äîparticularly on the West coast‚Äîare also increasingly crammed with a vast amount of popular live programming.  This problem is especially true around certain times of the year.  According to the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), popular sports programming and coveted national and local news programming squeeze schedules so tightly that some stations have preempted local newscasts to satisfy the rigid requirements of the FCC‚Äôs Kid Vid rules.  Second, displacing programming that viewers seek and want for questionable Kid Vid programming depresses the value of broadcast stations and threatens their financial resources to create and air costly programming, like news and community specials, or pay the bills for other programming, like network or syndication programs.  One can only wonder how this effects other public interest obligations, such as localism and competition.       Kills Shorter and Infrequent Programming ‚Äî The Kid Vid requirement that children‚Äôs core programming must run not less than 30 minutes has had a perverse effect.  In essence, it has killed any educational or informational programming of a shorter timeframe that could benefit children viewers.  For instance, the 1970s ever-popular and educational short animated skits under the umbrella of Schoolhouse Rocks, including ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Just a Bill,‚Äù would not qualify for purposes of Kid Vid, acting as a deterrent for broadcasters to invest in such programming.  At the same time, everyone knows that peak attention span is less than 30 minutes.  That‚Äôs why the famous Ted talks are allowed to be a maximum of 18 minutes.  Similarly, it‚Äôs why you see short segments in most children‚Äôs programming on non-broadcast channels.  Beyond the length of the programming, the Commission‚Äôs rules also hamper non-regularly scheduled programming.  For example, in the 1996 order the Commission rejected the argument made by broadcasters that even though highly popular specials, such as the ‚ÄúABC Afterschool Specials,‚Äù were not regularly scheduled, such programming was heavily promoted and advanced the Commission‚Äôs goal of providing educational and informational children‚Äôs programming.  Instead, the Commission concluded that specials would not be credited as core, halting the development of similar popular programming.  Imposes Costly & Burdensome Paperwork ‚Äî Beyond just the sheer logistical challenges associated with our rules, the reporting requirements impose heavy burdens that force broadcasters to devote substantial resources to paperwork, rather than local programming.  For example, NAB recently quantified Kid Vid paperwork burdens.  One group that owns 15 television stations filed with the FCC reports totaling 473 PDF pages (averaging 31.5 pages per station) in the first quarter of 2017.  Based on these numbers, NAB predicted that by the end of 2017 the group would file approximately 1,892 pages that merely explained what children‚Äôs programming they aired.[11]  Not only are these requirements burdensome, they are unnecessary.  Why should a broadcaster have to list out the exact programs they aired in the previous quarter?  Isn‚Äôt all that information publicly available for anyone with rabbit ears?  Not to mention, a typical consumer is one remote button away from a channel programming guide.  Surely most parents would prefer to plan their child‚Äôs viewing experience this way rather than refer to a broadcast station‚Äôs public file.  Thus, it is hard to see how these reporting burdens have accomplished anything more than just taking up both the broadcasters‚Äô and the Commission‚Äôs resources with nothing to show for the trouble.  Interferes with Development of Internet Content ‚Äî At the time of the CTA and the subsequent Commission actions since then, the Internet did not play a significant role in offering children educational and informational materials.  Today, the world has changed completely and the disruptive nature of the Internet has spread to children‚Äôs content as well.  Spending countless time on Kid Vid rule compliance and the Kid Vid commercial limitations on websites and host selling prevents some broadcasters from dedicating additional resources to these sites and keeps others from investing at all.  Today, children are just as likely to view content on an iPad as a television set and apps designed for children can be just as informational and educational as programming.  Perhaps, the Commission should substitute any Kid Vid requirement for broadcasters that create or join children-centric Internet sites.  We also should consider if there are ways we can modify our website and host selling rules to reflect the important role the Internet can play in educating children and ensure that parents have the opportunity to learn where and how they can access such sites or apps.    *             *             * For the multitude of reasons provided, it is high time the Commission consider whether the Kid Vid rules are still necessary.  At the very least, there are substantial portions of these rules that can be rolled back or reconsidered.  I hope as the Commission continues down its media modernization path, this rule will be part of the equation.

68	Repairing the Must Vote Timing	Michael O'Rielly	2018-01-09 10:30:00	1515519000.0	While I previously proposed fixes to improve the circulation process by making the documents public and addressing what amounts to stale items and those converted to Open Meeting items, we also need to update and improve the process for voting circulation items.  Unlike items disposed of at the Commission‚Äôs monthly Open Meetings, items circulated to Commissioners for consideration outside of the meetings (those on the Circulation List) have no voting deadline until they enter ‚Äúmust vote‚Äù status.  While that might sound like a concrete deadline, far too often, quirks in the process can delay the conclusion of items by over a full month, even for smaller or non-controversial items.  Accordingly, the Commission can and should expedite the must vote timing, which can be done without undermining the ability of Commissioners to examine, debate, and vote on any circulation item. By way of background, determining when must vote is initiated can be a bit tricky even for those who follow the Commission on a regular basis, especially since the process is not explained in any public document.  Under the Commission‚Äôs internal procedures, must vote is only triggered when an item sent internally by a Bureau or Office to Commissioners for disposal on circulation has sat for 21 days and has a quorum (i.e., votes by three or more Commissioner to approve, approve in part, or concur).  In terms of timing, the initial must vote deadline for any Commissioner that hasn‚Äôt previously voted occurs at the close of business twelve calendar days after the Friday after the must vote conditions have been met.[1]  For those counting along, that‚Äôs the second Wednesday after the relevant Friday.  Easy, right?  In addition, the must vote deadline may be automatically extended for one additional week at the request of a non-voting Commissioner.  Adding it all up, even if a majority of Commissioners vote in favor of an item the day it is circulated, it can take between 34 and 45 days before an item can be concluded under the must vote procedures.[2]  And that excludes, of course, additional discretional extensions that may be granted to accommodate further discussion or edits to an item as it comes to resolution.  While this process may have made sense when originally instituted, it‚Äôs appropriate to update the overall timing given our experience over the years.  In particular, I suggest that the timeline, which is not required by law or the Commission‚Äôs rules, can be reduced by eliminating the requirement that an item sit around for 21 days before the voting deadline is triggered.  While the original 21-day timeframe correlates to the number of days Commissioners have to review a meeting item before a vote, the ability to have an additional twelve days and a one-week extension means it can take longer to dispose of circulation items than meeting items, which are typically more complex and controversial.  At a minimum, this 21-day wait period could be trimmed by at least a week, but I would argue that it could be shortened even more.  Speaking from experience, doing so still gives Commissioners plenty of time to consider and vote on an item.   In essence, combining reform to the must vote timing with publicly releasing the text of circulated items (minus adjudications) would vastly improve the overall review and provide necessary scrutiny from interested parties of circulation items.  Just like making Open Meeting items public ‚Äì and huge appreciation is due to Chairman Pai for making this new practice permanent ‚Äì circulation items and the Commission at large would benefit from everyone seeing the exact text under consideration.  And, more targeted review complements the efforts to expedite the must vote process.  Thus, by revealing the circulation items in advance, we can appropriately speed up the clock on must vote.    [1] But, if quorum is achieved on a Friday after the initial 21-day waiting period requirement is met, the twelve-day clock does not start until the following Friday. [2] For instance, it could take 34 days to conclude the must-vote process if a circulation item is sent to the floor on a Friday and voted by three Commissioners on the same day.  After the 21-day waiting period, the must vote period would start on that day.  Twelve days later the must vote deadline would occur, unless a Commissioner seeks an automatic 7-day extension.  If an item was circulated on a Monday, the 21-day waiting period would expire on a Monday, but must vote clock would not commence until Friday.  If you add an automatic 7-day extension, the item would be pending for 45 days.  These numbers are representative of the timeframes that are experienced if an item is voted within the first 21 days after circulation.  However, if an item was voted on the 21st day after circulation and that day happened to fall on a Friday, the 12-day must vote period would commence the following Friday, meaning that must vote would conclude 41 days after circulation or 48 days if there is an automatic extension.  The circulation day is included in these figures. 	{0: {'username': 'quenn shaher', 'date_epoch': 1516118340.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-01-16 08:59:00', 'response_content': 'good'}}
69	Hurricane Season‚Äôs Over ‚Äì But Our Work Continues	Lisa M. Fowlkes	2017-12-07 13:45:00	1512679500.0	Last week marked the end of a devastating Atlantic hurricane season, which included four hurricanes making landfall in the United States and its territories.  While the season is behind us, recovery efforts ‚Äì particularly in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands ‚Äì are ongoing.  As the Commission works to support communications service restoration in areas hard-hit by the storms, we are also assessing what lessons may be learned from this experience and applied to future emergencies.  Today we issued a Public Notice seeking comment on the government and communications industry‚Äôs preparation for and response to the 2017 hurricane season, including what worked and areas for improving service availability and restoration during disasters. We want to hear from all stakeholders, including the public safety community; state, local, territorial, and tribal officials; industry; consumer groups; and federal response partners.  This input will inform the workshop(s) that we plan to hold next year to further explore the matter.  Our aim is to build on successful approaches and develop options to address shortfalls as we prepare for future disasters.  We are also considering what additional steps will assist this process. Communications networks are critical to reaching help, assisting emergency response, and disseminating vital information during times of crises.  We welcome your views as we work together to ensure that America‚Äôs communications networks are resilient against future disasters.

70	A Time to Give Thanks	Ajit Pai	2017-11-22 11:13:00	1511374380.0	"This Thanksgiving, we have a lot to be thankful for. In particular, we should be thankful for America's law enforcement officers. They put their lives on the line each and every day to protect us. Those of us in government‚Äîincluding the FCC‚Äîowe it to them to do whatever we can to keep them safe. We'll take up this cause at our monthly meeting on December 14. Specifically, we'll vote on an order to authorize the use of ""Blue Alerts."" Similar to the use of AMBER Alerts to notify the public of missing children, Blue Alerts may be used by state and local officials to notify the public of threats to law enforcement over the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system. The FCC has been working closely with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to help develop compatible and integrated Blue Alert plans throughout the United States. This past May, I attended an event at the Justice Department at which I was honored to stand with officials from that agency, the Department of Homeland Security, and other law enforcement agencies to declare my support for Blue Alerts and to pledge swift FCC action towards creating a dedicated EAS Blue Alert event code. At our December meeting, I hope the FCC will honor that commitment. The new Blue Alert event code could be used by state and local authorities to notify the public through providers of broadcast, cable, satellite, and wireline video services when there's actionable information related to a law enforcement officer who is missing, seriously injured, or killed in the line of duty, or when there is a credible, short-term threat to an officer. These Blue Alerts would also be passed through the existing Wireless Emergency Alert system so that the public receives them on their mobile devices. A Blue Alert could warn you if a violent suspect is in your community and tell you how to contact authorities and stay safe. Our December meeting will also feature an important proposal aimed at bridging the digital divide. Few sectors hold more promise for broadband-enabled advances than health care. This is especially true for rural and remote areas where telehealth services can overcome more limited health care access and vast distances. So I've shared a proposal with my colleagues to review the FCC's Rural Health Care (RHC) program. The program provides funding to eligible health care providers for communications services necessary for the provision of health care. For the second year in a row, demand for the RHC program will likely exceed the funding cap. As a result, leading participating health care providers may face unanticipated funding cuts. At the same time, the current RHC Program rules also open up opportunities for waste, fraud, and abuse. So any misspent funds come at the expense of health care providers (and their patients) that are acutely in need. In December, we'll take a fresh look at this program. We'll aim to figure out how it can operate more efficiently and have a sufficient budget so that Americans can get the advanced health care they need. Turning to the wireless sector, the FCC will vote on a Public Notice and draft Program Comment to facilitate the collocation of wireless equipment on so-called ""Twilight Towers."" That's a mouthful, but here are the basics. Between 2001 and 2005, a bunch of wireless towers were built. This happened before the FCC outlined the process for complying with historic preservation laws. A longstanding question has been how to certify that those towers are in compliance with our rules. Allowing collocation‚Äîthat is, different companies sharing space on a tower and installing their wireless equipment‚Äîwould have no adverse impact in the vast majority of cases. In fact, it would seem to be a happy medium; it would minimize any harms to historic properties while encouraging the efficient installation and operation of wireless infrastructure. The Commission has spent years negotiating with Tribal Nations and industry to find ways to use these towers without triggering the need for full historic preservation review. After more than a decade of inertia, we'll finally move to ease access to these towers. This solution was developed under the leadership of Commissioner Brendan Carr, who I have asked to lead the agency's efforts on wireless infrastructure. I am grateful to him for helping us resolve this issue. I'm also asking my colleagues to modernize our wireless rules at our December meeting. The Commission's current rules classify various wireless services as commercial or private. And they assume that licensees in certain frequency bands should be regulated as commercial. But that assumption is sometimes wrong, forcing licensees to ask us to waive these rules. The FCC routinely grants these waivers, but not without delays that can slow the rollout of new business plans. To promote more regulatory certainty and conserve our own staff's resources, we'll vote on eliminating sometimes inaccurate rule-based classifications. Speaking of modernizing our rules, we'll continue our initiative to update our media rules. This time, the Commission will consider a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that seeks public input on updating certain notice requirements that apply to cable operators. Among other things, we'll explore allowing these companies to send ""written"" (that's the word we use in our regulations) communications to subscribers electronically, rather than by paper mail. We'll also ask whether and how to update our rules that currently require broadcasters to send carriage election notices to cable or satellite operators via certified mail. Rounding out our December meeting will be two matters that were previewed yesterday. First, the FCC will consider an order that would restore Internet freedom and return to the bipartisan, light-touch framework that helped America's Internet economy become the envy of the world. In a recent op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, I detailed how the heavy-handed public-utility style regulations adopted in 2015 have stifled infrastructure network investment and innovation. Repealing these regulations will create jobs, increase competition, and lead to better, faster, cheaper Internet access for all Americans. My view is that the Internet should be run by engineers and entrepreneurs, not lawyers and bureaucrats. And unlike the previous Administration, which pushed through its Internet regulations without letting the public see what was being proposed, anyone can read my plan. It's on the Commission's website and available here‚Äîmore than three weeks before our scheduled vote. Second, consistent with my commitment earlier this year, the FCC will consider a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that kicks off a comprehensive review of the national television ownership cap, including the UHF discount. In 2016, the Commission (including the current minority) concluded that ""[it] has the authority to modify the national audience reach cap, including the authority to revise or eliminate the UHF discount."" We'll take a fresh look at this issue. A comprehensive review of the national cap and the UHF discount is warranted in light of considerable marketplace and technological changes since the national cap was last modified in 2004. Suffice it to say that the FCC will end 2017 not with a whimper but a bang. And we've been busy pretty much every month of this year. That we've been so productive is due to the tireless work of the FCC's talented staff. And that brings us back to tomorrow. As the nation pauses to give thanks tomorrow, I would like to offer my deepest gratitude to the public servants of the FCC. Every day, they help us strive to serve the public interest."

71	Thoughtfully Modernizing the Commission‚Äôs Media Ownership Rules	Michael O'Rielly	2017-10-20 14:35:00	1508535300.0	Last month, Chairman Pai appropriately promised at least one Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) per month to eliminate or modify unnecessary media regulations.  This month, he continues to make good on this, with important reforms that I have either advocated or supported: elimination of the main studio rule; elimination of FCC form submissions relating to ancillary or supplementary digital television income for parties that do not owe a fee; and updates to public notice requirements for certain broadcast applications.  This action comes on the heels of September‚Äôs reforms, where we updated technical requirements applicable to AM broadcasters, cable operators, and satellite providers and started a process to eliminate a rule that actually requires broadcasters and cable operators to maintain paper copies of FCC rules.  It boggles the mind to think that this requirement is still being imposed on relevant parties.  Moving forward, I continue to encourage broadcasters, cable operators, and other media stakeholders to share their ideas so that we can continue undertaking important reforms.  If a form is not needed, it should be eliminated.  If a study is duplicative or useless, it should be junked.  When public notice requirements are outdated, at the very least they should be modified.  And when FCC rules are no longer necessary, they should be removed from our books.  As many people, especially the Chairman, have properly articulated: it is time to update our rules to reflect the current media marketplace.  In that vein, it is long overdue for the Commission to properly and sufficiently reconsider its media ownership rules.  For nearly a decade now, the Commission has failed to adequately complete the statutorily-mandated Quadrennial Review of its media ownership rules.  As a reminder, this is not optional.  Congress initiated this requirement to ensure that our rules kept pace with the media landscape.  Upon this review, the FCC is to ‚Äúrepeal or modify any regulation it determines to be no longer in the public interest.‚Äù[1] Many of the Commission‚Äôs media ownership rules, written from a bygone era, are not serving the public interest, but frustrating it.  The competitive and diverse atmosphere we find ourselves in today warrants less regulation, not more.  It is time we fulfilled not only a congressional mandate but the congressional intent of keeping our rules current.  And this can and should be done thoughtfully, consistent with the fundamental propositions of localism, diversity, and competition.  We owe this not only to our broadcasting industry but more importantly, to the American people, who are paying for ‚Äì in one form or another ‚Äì market inefficiencies resulting from our rules. Last year, I outlined some basic principles to guide our review and reform effort.  Given the fact that there‚Äôs a new Commission with a more open and realistic outlook on the broadcasting industry, I believe it is timely to review, reconsider and expand upon those now.  From the outset, we must acknowledge a truism of the modern media marketplace: platform lines have blurred.  American consumers can access news and entertainment from social media giants like Google or Facebook, over-the-air broadcasters, over-the-top applications, fiber head-ends and wireless devices, wherever, whenever.  This is a wonderful development and a boon to consumer options for media content.           Broadcasters and newspapers can and should be allowed to fully compete in today‚Äôs environment.  But, FCC rules disproportionately apply burdens on these industries that are not imposed on their newfound competitors, nor should they be.  For example, under current FCC rules, a local broadcaster is prohibited from owning a newspaper in the same market (and vice versa), but nothing stops a tech company billionaire from acquiring this same entity.  Despite bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress and past FCC efforts to repeal this ban, the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules remain. These, and other rules, must go.  Below is a summary of principles I believe should be considered as part of any media ownership reform effort given the current environment: Reasonably Define Markets: We must define the media market as it exists today.  That means the inclusion of newspapers, radio stations, and television stations, but also their competitors: MVPDs, over-the-top providers, Internet sites, social media platforms, streaming music services, and satellite radio.  Once we accurately acknowledge the market we are regulating, we can have an honest debate about what rules ultimately make sense.    Eliminate cross-ownership bans: As consumers demand innovative platforms and seamless experiences to consume content, the FCC imposes bans preventing broadcasters and newspapers from delivering synergies that could result in innovative products and more, not less local content.  Eliminating the restrictions on newspaper/radio, radio/television, and newspaper/television combinations is a crucial step.  Previous commissions and bipartisan legislation from Congress already recognized the need for an update.  It‚Äôs time to act.  Eliminate Status Quo Duopoly Rule: Decades ago, when this rule was originally adopted, consumers had only a handful of programming options and relied on broadcasters for news and information.  According to Pew Research Center, in 1996, 65 percent of respondents reported using broadcast TV as a new source and only 2 percent ‚Äúgot news yesterday‚Äù from an online source.  By 2016, only 46 percent of respondents viewed broadcast TV as a source of news and 38 percent ‚Äúgot news yesterday‚Äù from an online source.  To my friends who think we need regulations to ensure a diversity of viewpoints, here‚Äôs a newsflash: you are regulating the wrong market.  Today, with thousands of new options, how can the FCC justify maintaining this rule in its current form?  In many markets, duopolies or even triopolies could strengthen the overall state of broadcasting and allow stations to concentrate more resources on bringing more and higher quality local content to their viewers.  Reject Additional Restrictions: Earlier this year, I applauded Chairman Pai‚Äôs move to reinstate the UHF discount.  Not only did this restriction harm the media industry, but the previous Commission lacked the authority to alter it.  Similarly, the Commission must resist calls that are counter to our goals of modernization and/or often outside the scope of our authority.   Examine Beyond the Petitions: While the Commission has before it petitions for reconsideration that challenge certain decisions in our last Quadrennial, there are a number of other ownership restrictions that need to be pursued.  It‚Äôs possible that procedurally we may be unable to address all of our media ownership rules now, but we must tee them up for future consideration. Ignoring them completely would be a dereliction of duty. Finally, I think it is important to address the elephant in the room.  There is currently a merger pending before the Commission that some argue will benefit from, and is the reason for, any changes to our media ownership rules.  While I make no comments regarding this, or any, merger application, let me be clear: this transaction is in no way the catalyst for FCC action on these issues.  First, the statute requires the FCC review its media rules.  Having failed that, we now have pending petitions before us to reconsider the past shoddy effort.  Second, I have been calling for media ownership reform since joining the Commission and as a staffer in the U.S. Senate before that.  It‚Äôs not a new position or reaction to a pending application.  Instead, for the first time, we finally have a Chairman receptive to these ideas.    *             *             * I applaud the attention of the current Commission to modernize the media regulatory landscape.  To date, we have addressed important, low-hanging fruit that will benefit consumers of media content ‚Äî with much more to come.  Time that was once spent on filling out irrelevant forms and resources once dedicated to maintaining unused buildings can now be put towards enhancing local content and products for the benefit of the consumer.  Despite this, true efficiencies are not possible until we update our media ownership rules.  I am hopeful this will come soon.    [1] Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L.

72	Modernization Month at the FCC	Ajit Pai	2017-09-07 14:15:00	1504818900.0	This week, I had the opportunity to travel to Texas to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey and to learn first-hand from local, state, and federal officials about the response and recovery efforts.  While many parts of southeast Texas are still drying out, the country is also paying attention to Hurricane Irma as it sweeps through the Caribbean and bears down on Florida.  As with Harvey, the Commission is working closely with our partners to monitor Irma‚Äôs impact on communication networks and support restoration and recovery efforts.  Although these historic storms have understandably been the Commission‚Äôs top priority over the past two weeks, the everyday work of the Commission goes on.  And today, we are announcing a robust agenda for our September open meeting.  Since becoming Chairman, I have consistently emphasized the need for the Commission‚Äôs regulations to match realities of the current marketplace. Our rules must reflect today‚Äôs technological and economic conditions, not those of yesterday. And at this month‚Äôs open meeting, we will advance this objective by focusing on whether to update or scrap outdated rules. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre dubbing September Modernization Month at the FCC. I already previewed two of the items yesterday at the Radio Show in Austin, Texas. One is the first product of the comprehensive review of our media regulations which we launched this May. The goal of this review is to update our media rules to reflect today‚Äôs media marketplace.  It turns out that one obsolete FCC media rule on the books is literally about books of FCC media rules. The Commission currently requires certain broadcasters and cable operators to maintain paper copies of FCC rules. With this information now available online, where it can easily be accessed from your smartphone, that doesn‚Äôt make sense. So we‚Äôll be voting on a proposal to eliminate this outdated requirement.  And this is just the start of our media modernization efforts.  The Commission received many good suggestions for rules that need to be revised or repealed. So for the foreseeable future, I‚Äôll be sharing with my fellow Commissioners each and every month at least one Notice of Proposed Rulemaking teeing up unnecessary media regulations that should be eliminated or modified.  The second item I discussed at the Radio Show is an Order that would update our AM radio regulations as part of our AM Revitalization Initiative. Specifically, we‚Äôll vote on relaxing certain technical rules applicable to AM broadcasters operating directional antenna arrays in order to ease the regulatory and financial burdens faced by these broadcasters.  Of course, when it comes to the media space, the FCC‚Äôs broadcast rules aren‚Äôt the only ones in need of modernization. Our cable regulations also haven‚Äôt kept up with the times.  For example, even though the vast majority of cable operators have transitioned from analog to digital, the FCC‚Äôs cable signal quality and signal leakage regulations are still designed for the analog era.  Back in 2012, the Commission proposed to update these regulations. Unfortunately, that proposal sat on the shelf for half a decade. No more. In September, the Commission will vote on an Order to modernize our signal quality and signal leakage regulations for the digital world.  You can add the satellite industry to the list of sectors where technological change has outpaced changes in the Commission‚Äôs rules.  Our current regulations covering non-geostationary-satellite orbit (NGSO), fixed-satellite service (FSS) systems were generally adopted in the early 2000s and reflect the satellite designs of that era. Given recent trends in the satellite industry and changes in satellite technology, the Commission began a review last year of the rules governing NGSO FSS operations to better accommodate this next generation of systems. These systems could expand broadband access, especially in the most rural and remote areas of our nation. And at this month‚Äôs meeting, the Commission will be voting to update and streamline several of our existing rules.  One area where we can least afford for our rules to be out-of-date is public safety. Here, one issue of particular concern to me has been the ability of Americans to reach 911 when using centralized communications systems, such as those that serve office buildings, schools, and hotels.  I've often spoken about Hank Hunt‚Äôs advocacy for Kari‚Äôs Law. This is legislation named after his daughter, who died during a fatal attack in a hotel room. Kari‚Äôs daughter tried calling 911 repeatedly from that room. But she never reached help because the hotel phone required that she first dial nine. I‚Äôm encouraged that both chambers of Congress recently passed versions of Kari‚Äôs Law, which would help ensure that Americans can call 911 directly. But there‚Äôs more that can be done to improve 911 calling in these environments. That‚Äôs why I have circulated a Notice of Inquiry that seeks information on why the 911 capabilities of these systems appear to be lagging.  We want to ensure that emergency calls from these locations are routed to the appropriate 911 call center and include the precise location and routing information needed for the caller to be found quickly. Of course, part of making sure our rules reflect the modern marketplace is accurately assessing current market conditions. Congress requires the FCC to issue an annual report on the status of competition in the mobile wireless industry and further requires the FCC to analyze ‚Äúwhether or not‚Äù effective competition exists.  At our September meeting, the Commission will consider the 20th Mobile Wireless Competition Report.  The Report covers a lot of ground, but the topline finding is that, for the first time since 2009, the Report would actually answer this question.  Specifically, the report reviews a number of facts, trends, and characteristics that taken together indicate there is effective competition in the marketplace for mobile wireless services.  I also think that it is important that Commissioners are once again being provided with the opportunity to vote on this. From 2014 to 2016, Commissioners weren‚Äôt allowed to vote on Wireless Competition Reports.  Instead, they were issued on delegated authority by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau. I objected at the time to bypassing Commissioners in this manner. Now, as part of our ongoing effort to bring more openness and transparency to the FCC, we are putting this year‚Äôs Report up for a public Commission vote.  In addition to changing market conditions, a big reason to modernize FCC rules is evidence that our rules are creating adverse impacts. Currently, all device manufacturers and wireless service providers, regardless of size, are required to file annual reports with the Commission detailing their efforts to make sure wireless handsets are compatible with hearing aid devices. Small and rural service providers, however, have repeatedly asked for relief from the burden of preparing these reports. In three weeks, we will vote on an item to seek comment on whether we can eliminate or streamline the requirement for small carriers, while continuing to preserve the benefits of collecting this information from industry.  The Commission will also revisit our rules for assigning certain toll free numbers. Specifically, we are seeking comment on using an auction to distribute currently unassigned toll free numbers that multiple, competing parties have expressed an interest in. Auctions could represent a more efficient and effective means of distribution because catchy numbers (for example, 1-833-LAWYER) would be provided to those that value them the most. Moreover, the funds raised by these auctions would help offset the cost of administering the toll free number system. At the same time, the FCC will seek comment on setting aside some new toll free numbers for health and safety uses by government and non-profit organizations.  And finally, we will be voting on an item from the Commission‚Äôs Enforcement Bureau. For law enforcement reasons, we are unable to discuss it publicly before our September 26 meeting. It‚Äôs been a busy month already at the FCC. And whether we are collaborating with our federal partners to respond to hurricanes or working to modernize our rules so that we maximize the benefits of communications technology for all Americans, we will continue to work the rest of this month and every month to advance the public interest.

73	Bridging the Digital Divide	Ajit Pai	2017-07-13 14:25:00	1499981100.0	Last month, I logged a five-state, 18-stop, 1,672-mile road trip from Wisconsin to Wyoming to learn firsthand about the connectivity challenges in that part of the country.  And this week, I took a three-state, 8-stop, 800-mile drive through rural West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland that highlights how the digital divide is hardly confined to the middle of our nation, but is a real and pressing challenge just a short drive from our nation‚Äôs capital. Consider this fact: more than 70% of the world‚Äôs Internet traffic runs through data centers in Northern Virginia, but you can‚Äôt even get 4G LTE wireless service on more than 7,700 road miles in rural parts of the same state.  And this is unfortunately common nationwide.  If you live in rural America, there‚Äôs a better than 1-in-4 chance that you lack access to fixed high-speed broadband at home, compared to a 1-in-50 probability in our cities. I saw the cost of lack of access at almost every stop during this week‚Äôs travels.  In Hampshire County, West Virginia, I heard how a resort in the town of Capon Springs that doesn‚Äôt have broadband has had trouble attracting guests who prize connectivity.  On that same stop, I spoke with the owner of a chocolate store from nearby Kirby who told me that poor or nonexistent Internet access prevents him from serving his customers, maintaining the store‚Äôs Facebook page, and growing his business. But this week‚Äôs road trip has left me invigorated, not discouraged.  That‚Äôs because I also saw firsthand the opportunities that are unlocked when next-generation networks connect rural communities. For instance, in Wardensville, West Virginia, I heard how broadband has enabled a transcription company that requires massive video downloads to thrive (it‚Äôs hired 28 full-time employees and plans to expand to two additional buildings in the near future).  And in Staunton, Virginia, I learned how a regional hospital has used connectivity and technology to stabilize stroke patients more quickly and cut the mortality rate from sepsis by 34%. And in Hagerstown, Maryland, I learned how the Washington County school system is incorporating broadband to help children learn, and how the On-Track program (motto: ‚Äúfrom cradle to career‚Äù) aims to use technology to prepare county residents to enter the digital economy workforce. With this week‚Äôs trip fresh on my mind, I‚Äôm pleased to announce that August will be Rural Broadband Month at the FCC.  Our agenda for the open meeting on August 3 will feature several items that will help bridge the digital divide. Leading off will be a Public Notice to initiate the pre-auction process for the Connect America Fund Phase II auction.  This auction will award up to $2 billion over the next decade to broadband providers that commit to offer voice and broadband services to fixed locations in unserved high-cost areas in our country.  To maximize the value the American people receive for the universal service dollars we spend, this will be the first auction to award ongoing high-cost universal service support through competitive bidding in a multiple-round, reverse auction.  With this Public Notice, we are seeking comment on the procedures to be used during this auction.  Moving forward now will put us on track to conduct the auction in 2018. The FCC will also consider taking the next step in implementing Phase II of another key universal service program, the Mobility Fund.  In February, the Commission adopted a Mobility Fund framework to allocate up to $4.53 billion over the next decade to advance 4G LTE service, primarily in rural areas that would not be served in the absence of government support.  The proposed Order on the August agenda would establish a ‚Äúchallenge process‚Äù‚Äîthat is, a process for resolving disputes over whether areas should be eligible for Mobility Fund subsidies.  This measure will allow us to proceed to a reverse auction as soon as possible.  It is critical that we use accurate data to determine which areas will be included in that reverse auction.  Many have complained to the FCC that the data that we currently collect through our Form 477 isn‚Äôt good enough to serve as the basis for that decision.  I agree.  Therefore, I am proposing to collect new and more granular data that will serve as the starting point in deciding which areas will be included in the Mobility Fund Phase II auction. Separately, we need to do a better job collecting data through the FCC‚Äôs Form 477.  It‚Äôs often said that you can‚Äôt manage what you can‚Äôt measure.  Consistent with that dictum, I‚Äôm proposing that we improve the data we collect about broadband service in America.  Specifically, we will consider changes to the FCC‚Äôs Form 477 to improve the value of the data we collect, while also identifying and eliminating unnecessary or overly-burdensome filing requirements. Increasingly, meeting the connectivity needs of all Americans‚Äîno matter where you live‚Äîmeans freeing up spectrum to meet the growing demand for wireless broadband.  That‚Äôs why, in three weeks, the FCC will vote on starting to explore opportunities for next-generation services‚Äîparticularly for wireless broadband‚Äîin the mid-band spectrum range (3.7 GHz to 24 GHz). Sticking with wireless, at the August meeting we will also vote on whether to replace a patchwork of service-specific renewal rules for wireless licensees with a consistent set of rules.  Uniformity provides certainty and promotes investment.  And it‚Äôll help ensure timely construction of wireless networks and intensive, continuous use of spectrum in all areas of the country.  We will also tee up whether we should increase build-out obligations for carriers that are seeking to renew wireless licenses so that more of rural America can receive service. Bridging the digital divide and expanding access to wired and wireless networks will be the central theme of our August meeting, but it won‚Äôt be the only focus.  We‚Äôll also vote on providing a waiver for a carrier identification requirement for satellite news trucks, and other temporary-fixed satellite earth stations transmitting digital video in order to alleviate the unforeseen, burdensome costs of compliance with respect to old equipment that cannot easily be upgraded.  The agenda also includes a Hearing Designation Order and an enforcement item, each of which must remain confidential until the meeting. In my first remarks to FCC staff as Chairman on January 24, I declared that my highest priority would be making sure every American who wants Internet access can get it.  During the almost six months since, we have repeatedly and consistently taken steps in service of this goal.  I‚Äôm pleased that our August agenda includes yet more measures that will help us bridge the digital divide.

74	Consumer Protection Month at the FCC	Ajit Pai	2017-06-22 14:20:00	1498166400.0	Americans are reaping the benefits of rapid and exciting changes in the ways we communicate.  But many of the problems that consumers confront stubbornly remain. For too long, Americans have been plagued by unwanted and unlawful robocalls.  For too long, they‚Äôve found unauthorized charges and changes to their phone service on their bills‚Äîpractices commonly known as ‚Äúslamming‚Äù and ‚Äúcramming.‚Äù  And for too long, some phone calls that are placed to rural residents have been dropped. Efforts to excommunicate this unholy triad of consumer scourges‚Äîunlawful robocalls, slamming/cramming, and rural call completion‚Äîheadline the FCC‚Äôs agenda in July.  During Consumer Protection Month, we will take up several public interest initiatives to address problems that too many Americans face. Robocalls Unlawful robocalls generate the most frequent source of consumer complaints to the FCC.  As agency-watchers know, we‚Äôre not starting from scratch in attacking the problem.  This past March, the Commission proposed to give voice providers greater leeway to block many ‚Äúspoofed‚Äù calls‚Äîspecifically, calls that purport to be from unassigned or invalid phone numbers.  This move will hopefully pave the way for Do-Not-Originate lists that will help stifle the efforts of illegitimate callers and scam artists.  And we‚Äôve made robocalls our top enforcement priority.  Just today, the FCC took a major step, proposing to fine the alleged perpetrator of a vast spoofing operation $120 million for the 96 million robocalls he unleashed on American consumers in just three months‚Äîrobocalls that bilked many vulnerable consumers out of their hard-earned money. In July, we‚Äôre going to address two other issues that could help combat robocalls.  First, we‚Äôll explore setting up a reliable system for authenticating phone calls.  Among other things, this system would verify that a phone call is really coming from the phone number that shows up on caller ID.  Right now, too many malicious robocallers hide their true originating phone number.  This lets them evade call-blocking or filtering tools and trick consumers about a call‚Äôs true source.  An authentication system would help to crack down on this behavior and strengthen call-blocking.  I‚Äôve shared a proposal along these lines with my colleagues. Next month, we‚Äôll also begin to address the problem of calls that are made to reassigned phone numbers.  Here‚Äôs the scenario: a customer consents to receive calls from a particular business.  But later, he switches phone numbers.  Someone new is then assigned that customer‚Äôs old phone number.  She ends up receiving calls that she doesn‚Äôt want.  This might seem like a highly specific problem, but an estimated 100,000 numbers are reassigned by wireless carriers every day, with errant phone calls following.  So this issue confronts millions of Americans.  To tackle this problem, the FCC will vote on considering how reassigned telephone number data could easily be made available to businesses, such as through a consolidated database.  Those businesses‚Äîrestaurants, furniture stores, and the like‚Äîcould use such a database to ensure that their calls reach the intended recipients. 2.  Slamming and Cramming Too often, we learn about unscrupulous carriers that are targeting the vulnerable.  For example, the FCC recently heard from an elderly woman who received a call about a postal service package that supposedly hadn‚Äôt been delivered.  Her verbal responses were then used to unwittingly switch her phone carrier.  This case is a bread-and-butter case of deception to ‚Äúslam‚Äù an older consumer. To address cases like hers, I‚Äôm proposing a rule to that would expressly ban misrepresentations on sales calls that typically precede a slam.  I‚Äôm also urging changes to our regulations that would make it harder for fraudsters to ‚Äúcram‚Äù consumers‚Äîthat is, put unauthorized charges on consumers‚Äô phone bills. 3.  Rural Call Completion Protecting consumers goes beyond just fighting illicit schemes.  It also involves making sure that they get what they pay for.  Unfortunately, rural telephone customers aren‚Äôt always assured of that.  Calls to rural areas drop or never go through too often.  In fact, we know that call failure occurs at higher rates for rural consumers than it does for urban ones. This isn‚Äôt right.  Whether you live in a big city or a small town, a call placed by a loved one, friend, or customer should go through.  In 2013, the FCC took action to address this problem.  The number of rural call completion complaints we receive has dropped since then.  But we‚Äôre still not where we need to be.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proposing new steps to make our rural call completion rules more effective and less burdensome.  In particular, I‚Äôm asking the FCC to adopt new, strong rural call completion requirements for certain telecommunications carriers.  At the same time, we want calls to rural America to remain affordable, so we‚Äôre looking at ways to reduce the burden of existing regulations, such as by eliminating some of the paperwork carriers must file with the Commission that hasn‚Äôt proven to be very useful. 4.  Helping Consumers with Disabilities Another way the FCC protects consumers is by making sure communications services are accessible to Americans with disabilities.  At our meeting, the agency will consider rules to expand the availability of video-described programming on top-rated broadcast and non-broadcast networks.  Specifically, we‚Äôll vote on increasing the number of hours of programming that covered broadcasters and video programmers must provide by 75%.  If we take this step, blind and visually-impaired Americans will be able to better understand and enjoy a wider range of popular programming. 5.  Other Initiatives Our consumer protection agenda for July won‚Äôt stop there.  Harnessing the power of technology to promote innovation is another FCC priority that empowers consumers.  This is increasingly true when they‚Äôre on the road.  For instance, radars in vehicles can enable a variety of safety features such as collision avoidance.  To encourage this kind of innovation, the FCC will consider rules that would allocate a large block of high-band frequencies (76-81 GHz spectrum) for use by vehicular radars‚Äîif you will, the advanced sensors that are being placed in cars.  This spectrum, among other things, would support new short-range radar applications to enhance driver safety. Rounding out the FCC‚Äôs July agenda is a proposal to bring our equipment authorization rules up to date, as well as a proposal to revise our rules governing wireless microphones. After yesterday‚Äôs summer solstice, the days are getting shorter again.  But the list of items on the Commission‚Äôs July agenda remains long.  During Consumer Protection Month, we‚Äôll extend our efforts to address the problems Americans confront in the communications marketplace and to crack down on those who prey upon the vulnerable for their own financial gain.

75	Heading Together Toward the Future	Ajit Pai	2017-06-02 15:12:00	1496441520.0	My post introducing the FCC‚Äôs infrastructure initiatives a few weeks ago mentioned Marty McFly‚Äôs misguided worries about running out of road in the 1985 film ‚ÄúBack to the Future.‚Äù As you might remember, Dr. Brown assured Marty that roads wouldn‚Äôt be needed in the future. The wireless networks of the future too will look very different. Instead of just big towers that intermittently dot the landscape, the wireless networks of our future will rely on much smaller building blocks‚Äîthings like ‚Äúsmall cells‚Äù and ‚Äúdistributed antenna systems.‚Äù These new kinds of infrastructure take up much less space. They are generally much less noticeable. They impact the environment less. And because they operate at lower power, they will be deployed at many more locations than towers. As we move from the networks of today to those of tomorrow, the FCC wants to work collaboratively with everyone affected‚Äîparticularly Tribal partners. That‚Äôs why, later this month, I‚Äôll hit the road to discuss this transition with Tribal Nations. Some FCC coworkers and I have been kindly invited to attend the Mid-Year Session of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), which is the ‚Äúoldest, largest, and most representative American Indian and Alaska Native organization‚Äù serving Tribal interests. We‚Äôll be participating in consultation sessions with a number of Tribes (and in addition to these NCAI sessions, dedicated FCC staff are already doing outreach to Tribes on both conference calls and visits to Indian Country). The FCC has a long and successful history of working with Tribes on a wide range of issues affecting Indian Country. These relationships led us to create a groundbreaking system, the Tower Construction Notification System (TCNS). This is an online system that notifies federally recognized Tribes, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and State Historic Preservation Officers about proposed wireless construction projects. The TCNS is widely acknowledged by Tribal Nations, industry, and other government entities as an important, effective tool to help ensure that these projects respect historic properties of religious and cultural significance to Tribes. The rules, protocols, and practices governing TCNS were crafted more than a decade ago, and as I mentioned earlier, advances in wireless networks are proceeding apace. It‚Äôs a challenge to match the two, but the FCC is aiming to do that in order to modernize our rules and close the digital divide. I‚Äôm excited to discuss this initiative with our Tribal partners. Going forward‚Äîjust as in the past‚Äîwe want to ensure that potential effects on culturally significant sites are identified and alternatives to avoid or minimize such effects are considered. I believe that the FCC and Tribal Nations share the same goal‚Äîensuring high-speed Internet access to anyone who wants it, while respecting and preserving sites with historic, religious, and cultural significance to Tribes. To achieve this goal, the FCC needs to and wants to exchange perspectives with Tribes on the full range of issues associated with the deployment of wireless broadband infrastructure. I‚Äôm personally committed to that. I invite the leaders of the 567 federally-recognized Tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations to join this important conversation. The FCC takes seriously its federal trust responsibilities and wants to have meaningful consultations. I look forward to listening, learning, and working together to sustain and improve our processes as our wireless networks go back to the future.

76	Would Means-Testing Bring More Efficiencies to the High-Cost Program?	Michael O'Rielly	2017-05-31 09:55:00	1496249700.0	"The American people rightfully expect that all federal programs operate as efficiently as humanly possible and are targeted to help those truly in need.  As FCC Commissioners, we have an obligation ‚Äì as stewards of federal programs funded by monthly fees on American‚Äôs communications bills ‚Äì to improve the functionality and effectiveness of the programs we oversee, including the Federal universal service fund (USF).  Failure to do so would waste consumers‚Äô hard-earned income, diverting it from the intended purposes and undermining public confidence in the programs.  While there is room for improvement in each of the USF programs, we firmly believe that it‚Äôs time to fix a fundamental structural defect within our high-cost program.  That is, we currently subsidize access to communications for people who don‚Äôt need or deserve governmental assistance.  In other words, we should end the practice of spending scarce USF high-cost support to illogically subsidize the cost of communications services for very rich people who happen to live in the more rural portions of our nation.  For example, if someone is earning one million dollars per year, why should the American ratepayer be subsidizing their telephone and broadband service?  And why are poor and middle-class Americans across the country asked to foot the phone and broadband bills of those in some of the wealthiest communities in America?  This is not about stoking a debate over societal inequalities, as we have no animosity towards successful individuals; instead, it‚Äôs about instilling some common sense in a government subsidy system where it is desperately needed.  Because of our budgetary constraints, each dollar spent subsidizing service unnecessarily is a dollar that is not being used to help bring broadband to unserved Americans, particularly those who cannot afford the full cost of service.  The following language is meant to spark a conversation on how best to institute means-testing within USF‚Äôs high-cost program.  Given the importance of this issue, we seek public input on whether this proposal asks the right questions to enable the Commission to fully consider this issue, including the consequences of moving to a fully means-tested program and ways to minimize the administrative burdens for consumers, communications providers, and the Commission.  In any event, we hope to bring this issue before the full Commission in the very near future so as to properly engage the entire American public.  *             *             * Use of Means-Testing to Further Target High-Cost Universal Service Support We seek comment on whether, and if so how, to implement means-testing within the high-cost universal service program.  Means-testing is the concept that government subsidies should be targeted to recipients who qualify for assistance based on their lower income and asset levels.  It is commonly used in federal government programs to establish or scale eligibility for benefits, including in Medicare, Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).  In addition, the FCC‚Äôs Lifeline program uses means-testing to direct assistance to low-income consumers that might not otherwise subscribe to phone or broadband service.  Recipients qualify for discounted service based on participation in SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, Federal Public Housing Assistance, and the Veterans Pension benefit program, as well as all current Tribal qualifying programs.[1]  Alternatively, consumers can qualify by demonstrating income of less than 135 percent of the federal poverty guidelines.[2] While high-cost subsidies are not currently means-tested, the idea that they should be is not new.  A 2002 report by GAO noted that there was support for making high-cost a means-tested program.[3]  In 2006, former FCC Chief Economist Thomas Hazlett observed that while high-cost subsidies ‚Äúmay enable some operators to offer prices as low as those paid by urban and suburban residents for service that is much less costly to supply, the lower prices are offered to all residents, rich and poor alike.‚Äù[4]  And a 2013 paper by Thomas Hazlett and Scott Wallsten stated that ‚Äú[t]he consensus among economists‚Äù is that the high-cost program is inefficient because ‚Äúpoor urban consumers pay significant telecommunications fees to subsidize affluent phone customers in Aspen, Colorado and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.‚Äù[5] Since that time, the Commission has taken a number of steps to root out inefficiencies in high-cost subsides.  In particular, the Commission has begun using reverse auctions to produce more efficient funding levels, targeted support to unserved areas, established a policy of funding one provider per area, and limited funding to areas where there is no unsubsidized competitor.  Indeed, because the high-cost program is subject to an overall budget, the Commission has tried to ensure that spending is as efficient and cost-effective as possible.  Notwithstanding these reforms, high-cost funding has remained subject to criticism for having ‚Äúperverse distributional effects, by subsidizing wealthy rural consumers, who are never subject to means-testing, but who can easily afford to pay the full cost of access.‚Äù[6]  The Commission most recently sought comment on means-testing in the 2011 USF/ICC Transformation Order and FNPRM.  In particular, it sought comment on limiting Remote Areas Fund support‚Äîwhich, at the time, was expected to take the form of consumer vouchers‚Äîto income-eligible consumers.[7]  We now invite comment on using means-testing more broadly within each of the high-cost programs.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of using means-testing?  Would it make the program more efficient as some commenters have suggested?  Given our limited budget, would it enable the Commission and/or providers to retarget funding to areas or consumers in greater need of support?  How can it be implemented without disruption to the current programs?  Should it apply on a going- forward basis as rules for additional parts of the high-cost program, such as the Remote Areas Fund, are adopted?  Could it eventually be implemented uniformly across all of the high-cost programs as they come up for renewal in the years to come, or would it need to be tailored to each program?  How can it be structured to be effective and with sufficient accountability while imposing the fewest costs on providers and consumers?  How should the Commission set income eligibility criteria?  How should the Commission structure means-testing in a way that is administrable for the Commission, companies, and consumers?  What data would the Commission need in order to effectively means-test the high-cost program? We also seek comment on specific ways to implement means-testing.  For example, should the Commission require that consumers identified as having adjusted gross income (AGI) levels above a set threshold to pay the full cost of providing service to their locations?  If the Commission were to adopt this option, how should it set the income threshold?  Would it be reasonable to select an AGI of $1 million or $500,000?  How would consumers above the threshold be identified?  Should consumers above the threshold be required to notify their provider?  How can providers make consumers aware of such an obligation?  Could they do so through an annual notice to their customers?  How can the Commission ensure compliance with such requirements? Another option is to utilize means-testing as a weighting factor in future reverse auctions or other distributions of universal service support.  We seek comment on this approach. For example, should the Commission adopt a weighting mechanism that would give preference to bids or builds that target low-income areas? What are the appropriate income cutoffs? What is the appropriate area to which a bidding weight or credit would attach? How strong of a preference should the Commission adopt for the lowest-income areas? What should the interplay be between these preferences and other weighting factors the Commission has adopted in the past? Alternatively, an idea that was incorporated into prior legislative efforts to reform universal service would have excluded support to service for ‚Äúconsumers in households in high-cost areas where the Commission determines, based on publicly available information, that a service area has a substantially high percentage of households with income at or above the 95th percentile of national household income levels or develops an equivalent measurement.‚Äù[8]  What information could the Commission use to make such a determination?  How should the Commission define ‚Äúsubstantially high percentage‚Äù?  Instead of service area, should the geographic area be a census block and, if so, how would that change the definition of ‚Äúsubstantially high percentage‚Äù? We seek comment on these and other ideas, including how they could be implemented in each part of the high-cost program, and the costs and benefits of doing so.

77	But Wait, There's More	Ajit Pai	2017-04-27 16:15:00	1493334900.0	Yesterday, I delivered remarks announcing my plans to repeal the Commission‚Äôs heavy-handed ‚ÄúTitle II‚Äù regulation of the Internet and return the United States to the bipartisan, light-touch regulatory framework that preserved a free and open Internet for almost 20 years.  To kick off this process, I‚Äôve shared with my fellow Commissioners and the American public a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that seeks public input on the best path forward.  This proposal will headline the Commission‚Äôs May open meeting, but it‚Äôs hardly the only piece of business we‚Äôll be considering.  Having already detailed my proposal to free the Internet from Depression-era regulation, I‚Äôd like to highlight the other items on our May docket. While they may not have received as much attention as my Title II rollback plan, I also previewed two items from our May agenda in a recent speech at the National Association of Broadcasters‚Äô annual gathering in Las Vegas. The first is an item to initiate a comprehensive review of our media rules to identify which ones are still necessary and which should be relaxed or repealed.  We not only want to root out antiquated rules that have outlived their usefulness, we also want to explore whether certain rules should be modified to provide regulatory relief to small businesses.  If approved, this item would solicit public input on which rules to modify and why. With close to 1,000 pages of rules on the books regulating broadcast, cable, and satellite television, many of them decades old, I‚Äôm confident this inquiry would uncover some candidates for reform.  (Note: this review will not cover the FCC‚Äôs media ownership regulations, which the Commission is already obligated by statute to review on a regular basis.) A second media item on our May agenda would eliminate one such counterproductive rule, which we have already identified.  To enable and encourage community input, each AM, FM, and television broadcast station is currently required by FCC rule to maintain a ‚Äúmain studio‚Äù that is located in or near its community of license.  But thanks to technological innovations, notably the online ‚Äúpublic file,‚Äù we can give broadcasters additional flexibility by repealing the ‚Äúmain studio‚Äù rule without sacrificing transparency or community engagement.  In three weeks, the Commission will vote on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that tees up eliminating the Commission‚Äôs main studio rule for both radio and television broadcasters.  My thanks to Commissioner O‚ÄôRielly for championing this cause. Next on the agenda will be a proposal to revise a rule that has directly harmed rural consumers.  In connection with the FCC‚Äôs 2011 reforms of the FCC‚Äôs subsidy program known as the Universal Service Fund (USF), the Commission required recipients of USF subsidies to impose minimum monthly rates for telephone service.  The thinking then was that the law calls for rates to be ‚Äúreasonably comparable‚Äù and that customers needed to pay a certain minimum rate to make sure that subsidies weren‚Äôt being wasted.  The problem is this so-called ‚Äúrate floor‚Äù now forces many rural customers to pay higher rates than some of their urban counterparts, including those in Washington, D.C.  It seems to me that the last thing the FCC should do is mandate price increases for rural consumers above rates paid by some of their urban counterparts, especially considering that average incomes in rural areas tend to be lower than those in cities.  Also, the law requires ‚Äújust, reasonable, and affordable‚Äù rates, which the rate floor doesn‚Äôt seem to respect.  The FCC therefore will be voting on an NPRM to eliminate this rate floor and related reporting requirements.  We will also be voting to immediately freeze the rate floor to prevent rural telephone rates from rising in July.  The Commission will also consider a Report and Order that would amend our rules regarding wireless devices such as walkie-talkies, CB radios and remote-control toys‚Äîwhat we call Personal Radio Services.  These devices generally use low-power transmitters, communicate over shared radio frequencies, and (with a few exceptions) do not require an individual FCC license for each user.  The Commission will be voting to complete a thorough review of our Personal Radio Services rules in order to modernize them, remove outdated regulatory requirements, and reorganize them to make it easier to find information.  Finally, the Commission will be taking up a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to streamline our rules that govern the antennas (earth stations) used to provide satellite-based services to ships, airplanes and vehicles on the ground.  The regulation of these earth stations, collectively known as ‚Äúearth stations in motion‚Äù (ESIMs), currently varies depending on the type of vehicle to which they are attached.  We will consider new rules for the operation of ESIMs that would eliminate redundancies, reduce the burden on our applicants, and allow FCC staff to process applications more quickly. No question, my proposal to repeal Title II regulation and restore Internet freedom will garner most of the headlines on May 18.  But, make no mistake: the FCC will be taking up a diverse array of additional proposals to modernize our rules and deliver benefits to consumers.

The fundamental foundations and science of the internet were funded by public taxpayer money. We, the taxpayers and citizens of the U.S., are the original investors and underwriters of the internet, and yet Pai is suggesting that we now allow a select group of corporations to amass even greater wealth from our investment. Worse, the U.S. already has the most expensive and poorest quality internet service of the major developed countries. Pai claims his proposed changes are to promote business, but in fact, an open internet is essential to allowing millions of small businesses to not only be created but to remain in existence; an open internet has been the greatest creator of business launches since at least the invention of steam, if not the wheel. But, obviously, Pai is not interested in research, reason or rational analysis of the actual value of the internet to U.S. business, democratic or even defense needs, so I recommend that we make it quite clear to ALL of the Fox channel viewers and Huffington Post readers that should this theft of one of our most valuable national resources be permitted, we will lose our Facebook, Google search, live streaming and other connections we've come to rely on in the 21st Century.

They said, to mandate neutrality, the FCC has to first reclassify broadband service. And Tom Wheeler did so. Now, you need to stay put. Nothing has changed in these intervening years. I still have only two broadband companies that serve my neighborhood, most people only have one, and my two choices both operate an MVPD service too. Which means, net neutrality goes against their MVPD self-interests. And no, it is certainly NOT Title II that prevents more competition. It's simple economics.

78	International Efforts to Regulate the Internet Continue	Michael O'Rielly	2017-04-21 15:15:00	1492812900.0	Over the last several years, we‚Äôve been lectured by many that the U.S. position on Internet governance was no longer sustainable in the larger, global community.  So-called experts claimed that the U.S.‚Äôs minimal government involvement in Internet issues was no longer a prudent approach.  These ‚Äúexperts‚Äù added that if the U.S. just ceded on our sound principles a little bit, authoritarian governments of the world would end their continued effort to seek increased government regulation and control of the Internet.  In other words, they sought an appeasement strategy.   We now have a recent case study of this exact approach, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have worked.  Instead, some foreign governments have renewed their disturbing calls for government involvement in the Internet via a number of forums.  Accordingly, it‚Äôs time to reject appeasement, acknowledge the work ahead and redouble our efforts to quash these attempts using all appropriate means. The ICANN Experiment In October 2016, the US government officially terminated its last remaining contractual relationship with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).  Supporters of the transition argued that it was the best means for the continued growth of the Internet, but many admitted, behind closed doors, that the whole process was meant to serve two purposes: to overcome the Edward Snowden controversy and to reduce the international pressure over Internet governance issues.  Those who challenged the initial decision and its subsequent transition ‚Äì of which I was one ‚Äì argued, in part, that it would never serve to halt the efforts by some countries seeking international regulation of the Internet.  Despite my overall support for multi-stakeholder Internet governance methods, I didn‚Äôt believe for a second that the transition would prove sufficient to deter world despots seeking more control over the Internet.  As we pass the six-month anniversary of the reconstituted ICANN, it only seems appropriate to assess the current situation.  Not surprising, authoritarian governments continue to persist in their efforts to have multilateral organizations, such as the UN, regulate the Internet.   Case in point, Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs assistant recently stated in an interview that the ICANN transition did not change its overall stance and Russia will continue to pursue government involvement, perhaps through the U.N.‚Äôs International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in the workings of the Internet.  Below are just three examples of government actions to pursue such a path.  World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA-16) At the end of October, the international community convened at the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA-16) in Tunisia.  This conference, held by the ITU, considered how countries should regulate technologies through the standards process to promote worldwide Internet access.  Member States specifically discussed such topics as the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, privacy, and the possible regulation of Internet companies and applications.  Specifically, the ITU Member States embarked on a discussion of the standards needed to facilitate such regulation and deployment.  ITU participation in the Internet standards process would be a marked departure from its stated mission of international telecommunications coordination.  Since we already have several multi-stakeholder standards setting bodies, such as IEEE, 3GPP and IETF, who formulate standards for Internet, mobile and IoT platforms, the ITU‚Äôs insertion here would seem to duplicate or interfere with the work of these established organizations.  But that wasn‚Äôt the worst idea coming out of Tunisia.  During the conference, ITU Member States decided to promote a specific technology ‚Äì Digital Object Architecture (DOA) ‚Äì for IoT.  This proposal is troubling in many respects.  First, DOA is capable of assigning a unique identifier to each IoT and mobile device allowing for the tracking of such equipment and, more importantly, every individual user.  In fact, authoritarian regimes are proposing the registration of all devices and users in centralized databases for the very purpose of making surveillance that much easier.  Second, if these DOA ‚Äútools‚Äù are mandated for IoT devices, it will facilitate and expedite future regulation.  Each communication could be traced allowing fees and taxes to be levied on financial transactions, purchases, or even content streaming, among other communications.  Third, abandoning technological neutrality by forcing DOA likely will stymie future innovation from competing technologies.  Going down this DOA path essentially places the ITU in the driver‚Äôs seat when it comes to the future of the Internet.  Moreover, all of the efforts at WTSA-16 should be seen through the lens of expanding the mission of the ITU, allowing it to regulate the Internet and provide Member States with an avenue for obtaining standards and Internet controls that they are unable to get through other means. China‚Äôs New Position Paper In early March, China detailed, in a document entitled ‚ÄúInternational Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace,‚Äù its plan to seek global, multilateral governance of the Internet.  Specifically, it asserts that ‚Äú[t]he international community needs to ‚Ä¶ put in place a multilateral, democratic and transparent global governance system...,‚Äù and governments should ‚Äútak[e] the lead[] in internet governance particularly public policies and security.‚Äù  The policy statement explicitly states that, as part of its ‚ÄúPlan of Action,‚Äù China ‚Äúsupports formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behavior in cyberspace within the framework of the United Nations, which will establish basic principles for states and other actors to regulate their behavior‚Ä¶.‚Äù  Further, ‚ÄúChina supports discussion on privacy protection at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and calls for establishing relevant principles for protecting individual privacy in cyberspace.‚Äù Whether in the guise of cybersecurity, privacy, or promoting general Internet governance, one must ask: On whose fundamental governance principles would these rules be based?  The U.S., for instance, has First Amendment and other constitutional protections, whereas China states that although it ‚Äúrespects citizens‚Äô rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace,‚Äù these claimed rights are clearly curtailed to ensure ‚Äúnational security and public interests.‚Äù  I must assume that these public interests align with China‚Äôs earlier statement that limits the rights of Chinese citizens on the Internet such that: [N]o organization or individual may produce, duplicate, announce or disseminate information having the following contents: being against the cardinal principles set forth in the Constitution; endangering state security, divulging state secrets, subverting state power and jeopardizing national unification; damaging state honor and interests; . . . jeopardizing state religious policy, propagating heretical or superstitious ideas; spreading rumors, disrupting social order and stability; . . . and other contents forbidden by laws and administrative regulations. And, as we know, this issue is not specific to China as many governments seek to restrict Internet use by their citizens to inoculate themselves from criticism. ITU and Over-the-Top Content Finally, in late February, an ITU study subgroup held a meeting to discuss the growth of over-the-top (OTT) content.  During this meeting, a recommendation was put forth by Russia and some African countries to define and potentially regulate OTT, which will be considered by the full study group later this month.  This appears to be an attempt to expand ITU jurisdiction well beyond international telecommunications networks to include the Internet, as well as edge providers, including those offering video and audio streaming.  Further, the ITU Member States are considering studies on such topics as the regulatory impact of OTT services on licensing frameworks, pricing and charging, security and data protection, taxation and consumer protection.  While these studies are pushed under the pretext of encouraging competition, innovation, and investment, this should be seen for what it is: the first steps toward the international regulation of, in many cases, Internet-based edge providers. *                    *                   * These are three examples of certain governments‚Äô efforts to advocate for the international regulation of the Internet since the ICANN transition.  In merely six months, there have been multiple plans and proposals to directly involve UN entities in Internet governance.  I think it is safe to say that we got the short end of the stick.  Hopefully, a lesson has been learned and we will no longer compromise the U.S. position in order to placate those who cannot be placated.  Now, we must do everything we can to stop these continuous and systemic assaults on the Internet.

79	Infrastructure Month at the FCC	Ajit Pai	2017-03-30 14:20:00	1490908800.0	"I recently watched the 1985 classic ""Back to the Future."" At the end of the movie, Marty McFly warns Dr. Emmett Brown as they prepare to head into the future, ""Hey Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88."" Dr. Brown replies, ""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."" It turns out that Dr. Brown was wrong; in 2017, we still need roads. But even more, what paves the way in the 21st century is high-speed Internet access, or broadband. That's certainly what we believe here at the FCC. And that's why our goal is to make sure that every American can get faster, cheaper, and better broadband. Next-generation networks are hard to build. It takes a lot of money and effort to lay fiber, install wireless infrastructure, build satellite earth stations, and more. It also requires a reasonably certain business case for deployment, which is all too often hard to prove in parts of the country with sparse population and/or lower incomes. But the benefits of doing so are tremendous. Infrastructure investment is critical to closing the digital divide in our country and bringing high-speed Internet access to more rural Americans. Broadband has also made many sectors of the economy more productive, from shipping to energy. And it's has given birth to entirely new industries, like the mobile apps economy, telemedicine, online education, and the nascent Internet of Things. To bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans, the FCC needs to make it easier for companies to build and expand broadband networks. We need to reduce the cost of broadband deployment, and we need to eliminate unnecessary rules that slow down or deter deployment. At next month's Commission meeting on April 20, the FCC will be voting on a number of proposals to do just that. That's why we are calling April ""Infrastructure Month"" at the FCC. 1. Wired Infrastructure. ‚Äî In one set of proposals, I'm asking my colleagues to support rules that would facilitate the construction of wired networks. For example, attaching Internet-related equipment to utility poles is a major cost element for companies of all sizes. We'll seek to both lower costs for and speed deployment of this equipment. I'm also proposing rules to allow companies to speed the retirement of legacy copper networks, some of which were installed many decades ago, and expedite the transition to newer, more resilient, higher-capacity fiber-based networks and services. After all, every dollar spent maintaining the fading networks of yesterday is a dollar that can't be spent building the networks of tomorrow. Finally, I am teeing up questions about whether state and local regulations are stifling network deployment and whether the FCC should consider using its authority to preempt any unnecessary regulatory roadblocks. 2. Wireless Infrastructure. ‚Äî Next, the Commission will focus on the wireless side of the equation. The wireless networks of the future will look very different. Instead of tall towers you can see from a mile away, there will be small cells ‚Äî wireless access points you might not even see and/or could hold in your hands. With this ""densification"" of so-called 5G networks, we'll need to deploy millions of small cells in order to realize the promise of multi-gigabit connectivity through millimeter-wave technology. That's why I'm advancing proposals to make it easier for the private sector to build these ""5G"" networks. We'll aim to expedite state and local approval of infrastructure deployment applications and streamline our own rules to account for these new networks. Regulations designed for big towers don't necessarily make sense for small cells. So we need to modernize our rules to keep up with technology. 3. Business Data Services. ‚Äî Speaking of modernizing our rules that affect infrastructure investment, next month we'll also vote on new rules to update the rules for business data services (BDS), otherwise known as ""special access."" BDS involves network connections used by businesses, non-profits, and government institutions to securely move large amounts of data. ATM withdrawals and credit card transactions are examples of how we rely on these services. Twelve years ago, the Commission began to study the business data services market to see if changing market conditions warranted changes to our rules. At long last, the time for action has arrived. I'm proposing that we take a balanced approach to reforming the rules governing this marketplace. The extensive record compiled by the Commission's excellent staff shows substantial and growing competition in many areas of the country, thanks to new market entrants like cable companies. Where this competition exists, we will relax unnecessary regulation, thereby creating greater incentives for the private sector to invest in next-generation networks. But where competition is still lacking, we'll preserve regulations necessary to prevent anti-competitive price increases. 4. Facilitating Rural Deployment. ‚Äî As I mentioned earlier, there are some parts of this country, primarily rural America, where the business case for broadband deployment is very difficult, and the private sector lacks the economic incentives to build out next-generation networks no matter how many regulatory barriers the Commission removes. For those areas that are the most expensive to serve, the Commission provides direct support to companies through the Universal Service Fund (USF). The USF's high-cost program subsidizes broadband deployment for small carriers. I am proposing that we tweak one of the rules for that program to make sure that some rural households that could be served by these carriers are not left stranded without broadband service. While infrastructure will be the focus of the Commission's April meeting, it won't be the only subject we're addressing. If we're majoring in infrastructure next month, you could say that we're minoring in media, with three items on the agenda. 5. Easing Burdens on Noncommercial Stations. ‚Äî Recently, the FCC adopted a rule requiring officers and members of boards of directors of noncommercial educational (NCE) broadcaster stations to provide personal information to the FCC. However, public television and radio stations have complained that this rule is discouraging volunteers from serving in these positions. In my view, we should be thanking people who want to serve their community in this way, not imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens upon them. So next month, we'll be voting to eliminate this rule. 6. Allowing Broadcasters to Raise Funds for Charity. ‚Äî We will also consider giving NCE broadcasters more flexibility to raise money for disaster relief groups, charities, and other non-profit organizations. In the past, the FCC has granted waivers to allow NCE television and radio stations to solicit donations for causes such as Hurricane Katrina and Haitian earthquake relief. I believe that we should make it easier for stations to engage in this type of activity so long as it doesn't compromise their non-commercial nature. That's why I'm proposing that stations be allowed to devote no more than 1% of their total annual airtime to fundraising for non-profit organizations. Moreover, because certain stations have indicated that they have no interest in engaging in such activity, this rule change would not apply to stations funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 7. UHF Discount. ‚Äî Finally, we'll consider whether to restore the so-called Ultra-High Frequency, or UHF discount, which is related to the Commission's national television ownership cap. Last September, the FCC voted to eliminate the discount on a party-line vote. That decision has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In my view, the FCC is likely to lose that litigation because it went about eliminating the UHF discount in the wrong way. So I'm proposing that we hit the reset button, returning the rule to the way it was up until last fall. And then we'll launch a comprehensive review of the national ownership cap, including the UHF discount, later this year. * * * Keeping with recent trends, the FCC's April meeting will be a busy one. But it'll be an important one ‚Äî Infrastructure Month will present several chances for the FCC to promote deployment and benefit consumers across America. Infrastructure might not be as flashy as a flux capacitor, but it'll be a 1.21 gigawatt jolt for the digital economy."

80	Improved Staff Openness & New Priorities	Michael O'Rielly	2017-03-22 12:05:00	1490209500.0	One of the hallmarks of any successful organization is open, effective internal communication.  The FCC is no different, and the sharing of such information is critical in the decision-making process, whether it be simple facts and data points or more complicated analysis and expert opinion.  So in my past interactions with the wonderful professional staff during the prior Commission, it was disappointing to find that reticence sometimes seemed to be the order of the day, rather than a free-flowing exchange.  I have always strived to maintain open lines of communication throughout the agency, through regular meetings with the leadership of Bureaus and Offices, but in too many conversations, some of the most knowledgeable people in the building seemed to be under direction not to share certain information or answer certain questions.  Sometimes I would get a wry smile, other times it was a blank stare, and occasionally there was a more honest response that the information wouldn‚Äôt be forthcoming.  Frustrating indeed. I certainly respect the need to prevent the release of sensitive information and prevent staff from wasting their time on endless requests.  At the same time, there is a difference between asking staff to share data points needed to make a decision and seeking internal deliberative work that could undermine the Chairman‚Äôs agenda, which is certainly a much smaller universe.  Commissioners can be informed if a project request is too time-consuming or staff intensive to see if modifications can be accommodated. So, one of Chairman Pai‚Äôs most welcomed, yet least noted, process reforms has been his unequivocal direction that staff should be completely up front with all Commissioners, not just the Chairman.  The message from the Chairman was that all staff will not withhold information requested by Commissioners or fail to share information that is pertinent to the many matters before us.  This should be very liberating for staff as they don‚Äôt have to worry about being sent to the proverbial doghouse for helping Commissioners do their jobs. While in some ways it might be easier for me as a member of the new majority to get my questions answered, I recognize that it places minority Commissioners in a terrible position, and I believe no one should ever be put in that position again.  Add this one to the list of reforms for which Chairman Pai should be congratulated.  It is also one that needs to be memorialized in a complete update of the Commission‚Äôs internal rulebook so the next Commission follows the same improvements. New Priorities and Workload At a time when Commission leadership has changed and is reconsidering and reconstructing its approach to many issues across the agency, there needs to be a realization from everyone that those priorities of the past Commission ‚Äì not directly required by statute ‚Äì should not necessarily be the focus of staff time.  With resources at such a relative premium, staff attention shouldn‚Äôt be spent pursuing outdated goals.  This concept should apply not only to our policy bureaus but the enforcement shop as well.  And it‚Äôs more than just deleting Brutus Buckeye from our memory banks.  For instance, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to have staff still focus their valuable time on those cybersecurity and privacy issues over which the Commission lacks statutory authority.  Moreover, our enforcement staff should move away from headline grabbing and eye popping penalties that will never be collected.  Let‚Äôs refocus our attention on our statutory responsibilities and realize a new Chairman gets to set the Commission‚Äôs agenda. *             *             * It is my hope that Commissioners and staff alike will embrace the new spirit of openness and take the step of getting on the same page.  This has the best chance of producing lasting and positive changes for Americans.

81	On the Road in the Industrial Midwest	Ajit Pai	2017-03-20 16:00:00	1490050800.0	"Famed American writer Jack Kerouac's masterpiece ""On the Road"" was published six decades ago this year. In the book, Kerouac conveyed a sense of the energy the main characters found away from home. As narrator Sal Paradise puts it, ""all I wanted to do was . . . go and find out what everybody was doing all over the country."" Inspired a bit by Kerouac, I hit the road last week. I visited Pittsburgh, Youngstown, Cleveland, and Detroit. Some might not think of these as glamorous travel destinations ‚Äî but that's precisely why I went. This proud region of the United States built our country. Our bridges were built with their steel and sweat. Our wars were won with their sons and daughters. Yet too many in these communities feel left behind. They are worried about the future. They are concerned that the good jobs that made these cities prosperous manufacturing hubs or steel towns in the 20th century are not coming back. Many had written off these former industrial powerhouses as early as the 1970s. Some still don't think of them as much more than fading tributes to the Rust Belt's legacy. But I had a feeling there was a lot I could learn there ‚Äî and I was right. There's a sense of hope in the places I visited, a sense driven by a determination to adjust to the changing economy and to pursue the opportunities presented by the digital age. I started off my trip at Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute, where I gave my first major policy address since becoming Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The gist of it was this: I believe that every American who wants to participate in our digital economy should be able to do so. Broadband Internet access shouldn't depend on who you are or where you're from. I also believe in the power of Internet-based technologies to create jobs, grow our economy, and improve people's lives in countless ways. High-speed Internet access, or broadband, is giving entrepreneurs anywhere an unprecedented chance to disrupt entire industries and transform our country. That's why my primary focus at the FCC is ensuring that we use every tool in the toolbox to boost broadband deployment throughout our country. I know that consumers everywhere want better, faster, and cheaper broadband. And I know that there's no limit to what Americans can achieve ‚Äî from Detroit, Michigan to Sioux Falls, South Dakota to Reno, Nevada ‚Äî if they're given the opportunity to take advantage of these next-generation networks. I had a chance to see these principles in action during my trip through the Industrial Midwest. I heard firsthand about the promise and perils of broadband deployment; about the entrepreneurship that was sprouting up along the way; and about the established companies that are creating jobs and innovating in these cities. (Oh, and I randomly ran into Calvin Johnson, the former Detroit Lions wide receiver, future Hall of Famer, and aptly-named Megatron.) 1. Broadband Deployment With respect to broadband deployment, I saw how companies are building ‚Äî or at least trying to build ‚Äî next-generation networks. For instance, in Detroit, I visited competitive upstart Rocket Fiber. The company's executive team started things off with a discussion about regulatory roadblocks. They had to get signoffs from multiple city agencies, none of which seemed to think that time was of the essence. And they had to get access to a large number of poles at a reasonable cost, which wasn't easy; the city at first sought a very high price for pole access (using as a benchmark the high rate charged to another broadband provider for access to just three poles). Fortunately, Rocket Fiber did manage to have conduit installed while the city was building the QLine streetcar; this is a big aid to deployment, which illustrates why I've called for ""dig once"" to be part of our national transportation policy. The challenge of deployment isn't limited to urban areas. I drove to a very small town outside Pittsburgh to check out a rural cable headend owned by Armstrong, a family-owned and -operated business. The rows of servers and power supplies and other equipment were humming along smoothly, providing service to thousands of customers in Pennsylvania and neighboring states. But what really impressed me was a series of maps which detailed Armstrong's service territory along with population density, average income, and more. Armstrong is offering 100 Mbps or greater Internet access service to customers in areas with relatively few people per square mile and with less than the national median income (each of which tends to limit returns on infrastructure investment). But thanks to initiatives like the FCC's recent decision to devote $170 million to increase deployment in upstate New York ‚Äî the first vote under my Chairmanship ‚Äî they're going to lay more fiber and connect more potential customers. 2. Entrepreneurs are Thriving As I said at Carnegie Mellon, ""High-speed Internet access, or broadband, is giving rise to what I have called the democratization of entrepreneurship. With a powerful plan and a digital connection, you can raise capital, start a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry."" More and more innovators in Pittsburgh, Youngstown, Cleveland, and Detroit are proving how true this is. For instance, in Pittsburgh, I had the privilege of meeting Priya Narasimhan, a Carnegie Mellon professor. Several years ago, she was at a Pittsburgh Penguins game. Being somewhat shorter of stature, she couldn't see the action on the ice. And she wondered why, with all the smartphones out there, she couldn't access information easily on her mobile device. So she founded YinzCam. Among other things, the company creates apps for sports teams and sporting venues and sets up beacons that allow highly-localized information to be distributed to fans. Their clients now include many National Football League, National Basketball Association, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and National Hockey League teams ‚Äî including, yes, her beloved Penguins. (And on a personal note, it was gratifying to me as an Indian-American to hear her story: her family came to America via India and Zambia, and she is a great role model for Indian-Americans and women in STEM fields.) I also had the chance to meet with the team at Duolingo, a Pittsburgh startup. Duolingo created a mobile app that allows people to learn new languages for free. It now has something like 80 million users around the world (about 20% of whom are in the United States). It was fascinating to learn about how they are developing revenue streams, how they essentially crowdsource lesson plans for new language courses, how they are trying to enter foreign markets, and how mobile connectivity is critical for the company and users alike. But it wasn't just Pittsburgh. One of my favorite events took place in Youngstown, where I had the honor of being hosted by the top-ranked Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI). YBI's Jim Cossler, an entrepreneurial force of nature and a champion of northeastern Ohio's potential, led a roundtable with innovative area startups and me. So many fascinating stories! There was Hudson Fasteners, a family-owned company going back to 1946. It once sold things like nuts, bolts, and screws in a bricks-and-mortar store and kept inventory on notecards until the 1990s. Today, third-generation owners Lisa Kleinhandler and Cris Young have created an online sales platform that they say ""put[s] the FAST in fasteners."" There was Enyx Studios, a virtual reality gaming company that kindly allowed yours truly to demonstrate his (virtual, anyway) incompetence during a demo. There was FoodECrave, a company that specializes in delivering perishable foods, especially meats, to small businesses and gourmands. There was MedaSync, a health care startup which created software that combines clinical and cost data to secure better outcomes for nursing home patients. And there was Ving!, founded by serial entrepreneur and Youngstown native Tony DeAscentis. Way back when, Tony left the area for tech jobs in big cities faraway. But now he's back, and with Ving!, he's aiming to help companies and individuals share more easily, and better understand third-party engagement with, their digital information. Later on at YBI, I spent time at America Makes, a national accelerator for additive manufacturing and 3D printing. In short, there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm in that room, not least from me (and I'm not just saying that because my in-laws, who live near Youngstown, were in attendance!). I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the Motor City, too, is motoring thanks to startups. There are a lot of smart, dedicated entrepreneurs helping to build a better Detroit as they build new businesses. Workit Health's Lisa McLaughlin is taking addiction treatment mobile with an online platform that is private and personalized. Lunar's Hunter Rosenblume has started a wireless company that provides talk, text, and data services without monthly fees. And CityInsight's Abess Makki aims to connect municipal governments with constituents through mobile technology, starting with an app that enables residents to track water usage in real time and manage billing. These entrepreneurs are helping the so-called Rust Belt shake off the rust. They exemplify the spirit of Kerouac's lead character, who said ""we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies."" And they illustrate the importance of high-speed Internet access anywhere ‚Äî with broadband, they can grow and thrive in soil once considered hostile to tech-based entrepreneurship. 3. Established Entities are Innovating, Too. One of the other insights I drew from the upper Midwest is that established entities, too, are innovating. For instance, I've long believed that better broadband access could dramatically improve health care accessibility and outcomes. While in Ohio, I witnessed that for myself. At the Cleveland Clinic, a group focused on clinical transformation told and showed me how it is developing telemedicine in innovative ways. It's using the Internet to connect health care providers with patients at locations as far away as Florida. It's set up a mobile stroke unit, cutting by an average of 38 minutes the time needed to assess and stabilize a stroke patient (precious minutes, indeed: such patients lose approximately 2 million brain cells each minute they're untreated).  Chairman Pai with Dr. Shazam Hussain of the Cleveland Clinic's telestroke team, among others. And it's established a mobile platform on which patients can easily see which providers are available, schedule impromptu or later appointments, and even send pictures of problem areas, like a skin lesion. (Notably, I was told that the typical user of this service is a mother of two in her 30s; that made me think of all the time and money she would save by not having to take time off work, find alternative child care arrangements, drive to the Clinic, and the like.) The Cleveland Clinic was an appropriate setting for the announcement that under my Chairmanship, the FCC will continue our work on our Connect2HealthFCC Task Force, the purpose of which is to ""explor[e] the intersection of broadband, advanced technology and health and further charting the broadband future of health care."" I look forward to further collaboration with my colleague Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who is leading our efforts on this important issue. Later in the trip, I visited General Motors, one of the country's best-known automakers. I learned about the team's efforts to develop safety-related technologies to cut down on crashes. And I was impressed by the OnStar team's discussion of how over the past twenty-plus years, the service had morphed from a curious feature to a sometimes life-saving connection. I could see on a massive dashboard how OnStar users everywhere were pinging the service. That brought home to me the unintended, serendipitous consequences of technology: the OnStar team probably never dreamed in the 1990s that their technology would be used by an American driver to help get information on delivering a child in a GM, or by a Chinese driver to propose to his then-girlfriend, but that's how it turned out. Finally, and consistent with the theme of major technology companies setting up shop in Pittsburgh, I visited Amazon. Amazon recently opened an office in a revitalized neighborhood in Pittsburgh. I had the opportunity to meet with core members of the team working on ""machine translation"" ‚Äî essentially, allowing speech recognition technologies like Alexa operate better. It was interesting to hear how they try to teach Alexa to factor in strong accents or focus on a particular voice. These aren't easy problems to solve, but the Amazon team is hard at work solving them ‚Äî and they're doing it in what was once a run-down part of the Steel City. * * * Sal memorably conveys his sense of optimism in ""On the Road"" when he says ""Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road."" That's how many people seemed to feel in Pittsburgh, Youngstown, Cleveland, and Detroit, and that's how I feel too. Spending last week there has made me more hopeful about our nation's future and the potential for high-speed Internet connectivity to help revitalize parts of our country facing economic challenges. And it's renewed my determination to pursue policies that will promote broadband deployment. We must bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans, not just those living on the coasts. I look forward to continuing that work, both back here at the FCC and the next time I'm on the road."

82	New Tower Marking Provision Could Use Tweaks	Michael O'Rielly	2017-03-10 12:00:00	1489172400.0	Having worked on numerous legislative efforts over the years, I have seen that it is not uncommon for very well-intentioned provisions contained within larger bills passed by Congress and enacted into law to lead to unintended negative consequences.[1]  One such provision recently enacted in an FAA Authorization statute is causing a considerable level of unrest within affected communications industries.  Specifically, section 2110 of the FAA Extension, Safety and Security Act of 2016 requires improved physical markings and/or lighting on various small to medium sized towers (i.e., those between 50 and 200 feet above sea level).  If implemented literally, the provision will force expensive retrofits to potentially 50,000 existing towers, such as wireless communications and certain broadcast towers, all new towers that meet the broad definition, and raise tower prices for the next generation of wireless services ‚Äì all with little gain to air safety.  I humbly suggest that a few helpful tweaks to the text could be in order.    It‚Äôs been portrayed that the scope of section 2110 was intended to be fairly narrow.  A number of articles and press stories indicate that it was designed to address the threat that small, low-flying aircraft, such as crop dusting planes, may face from temporary meteorological testing towers (METs),[2] a small subset of towers.  This also seems relatively consistent with the National Transportation Safety Board‚Äôs (NTSB) 2013 safety recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its 2014 Special Investigation Report on the Safety of Agricultural Aircraft Operations.  While there is little legislative history to review, the provision‚Äôs requirements apply to certain towers located outside incorporated cities and towns, on undeveloped land or land used for agricultural purposes.  It excludes those towers that 1) are adjacent to a house, barn, electric utility station, or other building; 2) are within the curtilage of a farmstead; 3) support electric utility transmission or distribution lines; 4) consist of certain wind-powered electrical generators; or 5) serve as street lights.  While the original intent of the provision may have been narrow, the language on its face is fairly broad, and therein lies the problem.  In essence, those structures that are not specifically carved out are captured.  That means that existing and future mid-sized communications towers throughout rural America are included.  Unfortunately, getting service to these areas has been a real challenge for the private sector and the Commission, mainly for economic reasons.  By raising the siting costs with new marking mandates, it is harder for companies to justify the investments and any current or future deployments.  In other words, if a wireless company has limited dollars to invest, this provision could lead them to direct those funds to areas that are not affected by this provision.  This also may make the business case for bringing future 5G wireless services, which are likely to require even more poles to support a small cell network, to rural America even more challenging than it already is.  Further, it could hinder the incentive auction television station repack and the implementation of ATSC 3.0, which is a broadcasting standard designed to provide greater service options.  Like many, I have argued repeatedly that we should remove barriers to the deployment of new wireless infrastructure, not add further ones unless absolutely necessary. In addition, the statutory provision excludes certain categories of locations or those with proximity to specific technologies, which teeters on the edge of unequal application.  It is perplexing that some technologies are specifically exempted, but permanent and non-moving communications towers appear not to be.  In particular, is there any data suggesting wireless or broadcast towers are more susceptible to be air safety hazards than towers used for electric utility transmission or wind turbines?  It would seem appropriate that communications towers should be treated similarly to those structures.   Adding to the overall difficulty, the text of the statute provides questionable flexibility to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  Arguably, the only way the Administrator could exclude a category of towers would be to redesign the tower marking guidance as part of the regulations required by the provision.  But we all know that this takes time and is quite an extensive process with an unclear outcome.  Without relief, communications companies will be forced to spend thousands of dollars per tower ‚Äì potentially hundreds of millions nationwide ‚Äì to come into compliance or face significant FAA penalties, and potentially FCC enforcement action, since we follow the FAA‚Äôs lead.  This suggests a small legislative fix may be the best path to adequately address the issue. I do not want to discourage or discredit any effort to protect the lives of those that fly agricultural aircraft or those on the ground.  In terms of air safety for smaller agriculture planes, however, there seems to be misconception that communications towers have served as a significant impediment or threat.  Even the NTSB‚Äôs Special Investigation showed that of the 78 small aircraft accidents in 2013 only 16 were involved in some type of in-flight collision with an obstacle.  While this may seem significant, it includes those instances in which the pilot was previously aware of the obstacle, meaning new marking requirements would have been ineffective, and those involving non-communications related obstacles, such as trees or METs.  Taking that into account, the data showed only two accidents involving communications towers.  Not to mention, other problems, such as pilot fatigue and mechanical failure, present an equal or greater threat to agricultural pilots.     In fairness, big communications companies can generally defend themselves, as needed.  But, the communications industry is not monolithic.  There are thousands of smaller providers, such as wireless broadband providers (commonly referred to as WISPs), that use wireless towers to bring service to the hardest to reach consumers.  Accordingly, the added cost of this new mandate could impact their ability to grow or even survive.  Plus, there are new responsibilities to map the applicable areas to which section 2110 applies, requirements to participate in and potentially fund a database of existing towers in these areas, and overall compliance costs that add to the burdens for small providers.  Moreover, in most instances, the costs of the marking requirements will be passed onto consumers, which is my main worry.  Increasing the costs of communications services for lower and middle-income Americans should cause everyone concern, as it decreases adoption rates and deprives these families of technological benefits. *             *             * Mandating new marking and/or lighting burdens for certain temporary aerial towers to aid agricultural pilots is a laudable goal.  However, the new statutory provision may have been drafted broader than intended and, as a result, it unnecessarily captures permanent communications towers that have little overall impact on agricultural air safety.  Taken together, it would seem that a small legislative fix to clearly exempt these towers or require the FAA Administrator to do so would be appropriate.   [1] Generally, I have avoided critiquing legislation passed by Congress without invitation.  This is an attempt to highlight a potential unintended consequence, rather than criticism.

83	States Must Stop Raiding 9-1-1 Fees	Michael O'Rielly	2017-03-01 16:52:00	1488412320.0	"It is unconscionable that some states divert fees collected for legitimate and needed 9-1-1 communications capabilities to unrelated purposes, threatening the public's safety for short-term budget relief.  After almost fifteen years of working on the problem, we are no closer to resolving it.[1]  I suggest that the appropriate policymakers must implement new measures to end this practice once and for all.  This may require uncomfortable conversations with states or taking forceful actions, as suggested below, but the current mechanism of shame and hope isn't working. On a daily basis, we ask our nation's public safety officials to risk their lives on behalf of their fellow Americans.  They run into burning buildings, stand in the line of fire, provide our loved ones' emergency care and do countless other acts of bravery.  The thanks some of these heroes get for their efforts is the siphoning off of needed resources intended to ensure their localized 9-1-1 systems are as modern as possible.  The inability or unwillingness to tackle this issue is equivalent to tying public safety officials' hands behind their backs during a major crisis and praying that things will work out.  It isn't right and it isn't smart. Today, the collection of 9-1-1 fees and surcharges is a hodgepodge of differing methods and levels by various states, tribal lands and U.S. territories.  As the National Emergency Number Association's (NENA) latest chart indicates, there is little consistency in the amounts that entities charge, and this doesn't include any additional surcharges imposed by some individual counties localities.  Specifically, NENA's data shows that consumers of communications services are paying a fee up to $1.75 per service per month to providers, who then are periodically required to remit the 9-1-1 fees to some state agency or organization.  Moreover, according to the FCC's recent report on the issue, states and territories collected over $2.6 billion in 2015 for 9-1-1 services under this fee structure. Despite the intended purpose of 9-1-1 fees, some states have diverted these resources to non-related or, worse yet, non-public safety purposes.  In fact, the Commission's report highlights that eight states and one territory diverted almost $220.3 million from 9-1-1 functions.[2]  These states (i.e., Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, West Virginia,) and Puerto Rico were found to have diverted approximately 8.4 percent of the total nationwide collections.  Upon closer inspection, however, the actual story is much worse for residents in those states and surrounding areas. Consider that the diversion rates in New York, Rhode Island and New Jersey were 42 percent, 68.4 percent and 89.9 percent, respectively.  Far from being de minimis amounts, these substantial redistributions undermine the ability of local public safety emergency call centers to modernize, such as adopting and migrating to Next Generation 9-1-1 systems (NG911). Some people argue that this is not a real problem because diverting states generally maintain reserve balances to pay operating costs as needed or that the entire issue will be take care of itself naturally once the economy improves.  Both of these lines of thinking are easily dismissed.  Even if a state is just diverting current collections because it maintains underlying balances in an existing account, the diversion generally prevents new investment in costlier, future networks as states don't want to deplete their accounts in total.  In other words, just paying to maintain older, outdated networks does not allow for growth, advancement or new technologies.  But we all know that significant investment ‚Äì not just maintenance ‚Äì is going to be necessary to develop and implement NG911 and Federal assistance in the form of grants under the Spectrum Act is rightfully precluded from going to diverting states.   And this is not just one instance of bad behavior.  Consider how many of this year's eight states are repeat offenders.  No fewer than four were in the Commission's first report on the topic in 2009 and others have been in the club before.  Moreover, new states are seeking to join or rejoin the party, seeing few barriers or repercussions from anyone but public outcry.  Take for instance, the latest effort by Montana's Governor, to repurpose $12.2 million of 9-1-1 reserves into its general fund to cover budget deficits.  Thankfully, that effort seems stymied, but it's only a matter of time before the next ""innovative"" state tries the same. Potential Remedies I understand why some see this as a vexing problem to solve.  It involves tax policy, jurisdictional lines, federalism, public safety, and consumers.  But if we are going to get serious about really resolving the problem, we need to get past these impediments.  Here are three non-mutually exclusive ideas for the Commission to increase the pressure and force states to end this despicable practice:  Interstate Services Prohibition ‚Äì The Commission maintains sole jurisdiction over interstate communications services and, as such, we retain the right to bar diverting states from imposing 9-1-1 fees on the interstate calls.  That means a good percentage of wireless services, landline voice services and all VoIP services, at least in my opinion, would be off limits for such states, while ensuring no greater burdens on affected industry.  In fact, the NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 specifically protects a state's authority to collect 9-1-1 fees on VoIP and wireless services, unless funds are diverted by a state.[3]  By prohibiting interstate services from being included as revenue sources, the pot of money diverting states would have to pickpocket would be minimized, sending a strong signal that the Commission is no longer going to sit on the sidelines with regards to this matter.  Moreover, we should not burden interstate services with activities that are at odds with federal policy.  This would be similar to universal service where states may assess fees on intrastate services, but only to the extent that doing so would not be inconsistent with the Commission's rules. Prohibit Collection and Remittance by Providers ‚Äì The Commission has previously prevented communications providers from including misrepresentations or inaccurate information in requisite consumer bills.  And it prohibits providers from collecting universal service fees in excess of what is required for the universal service fund.  For diverting states, the collection of funds above what will be spent directly on 9-1-1 services is by definition misleading to consumers.  The Commission can prevent any providers from collecting such funds or requiring them to remit the funds to diverting states.  As part of this effort, the Commission could also define what are inappropriate uses of 9-1-1 funds and ensure providers are held harmless in the process. Commission Advisory Committees ‚Äì The ability to serve on Commission Advisory Committees is a privilege, not a right.  As such, the Commission can and should exclude any person from a diverting state from participating on an advisory committee, and this can be done without losing valuable advice.  There are plenty of people able and willing to serve on our committees without including those from diverting states.  This idea was raised, but never fully considered, as part of a recent Commission Task Force. In addition to Commission options, Congress has full ability to correct diverting states' practices either by directly applying existing law or by exerting necessary leverage via its extensive grants and funding regimes. *             *             * If diverting 9-1-1 fees were a practice instituted by a private company, the Commission (and states) would have already thrown the enforcement book at them for gross negligence and misrepresentation.  Yet, we somehow have permitted states to divert necessary 9-1-1 resources or collect more than is necessary as if it were an acceptable practice.  It's time for that to end.     [1] I am far from the first government official to have raised this issue or the need for a solution.  Beyond my colleagues at the Commission, many Members of the U.S. House and Senate have examined this issue as precursors to the provisions contained in the NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008.  For example, see the discussion in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Report entitled ""The Enhanced 911 Emergency Communications Act of 2003.""  S. Rep. No. 109-130, at 3 (2003), https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/108th-congress/senate-report/130/1.

84	Taking Stock of FCC Paperwork Burdens	Michael O'Rielly	2017-03-03 16:15:00	1488582900.0	I am pleased that the Commission has begun to take steps to review and eliminate unnecessary burdens on the communications industry.[1]   It is a worthy task, and something I have been advocating for since I arrived at the agency almost three and half years ago. As the Commission embarks on these efforts, I thought it would be helpful to understand the current state of play. There are many types of costs that an agency can put on regulatees, but lacking solid information on most burdens due to the absence of cost-benefit analyses in prior items, I want to at least highlight one category of costs that the agency is required to track: paperwork burdens. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires the FCC to seek Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval before asking entities to fill out forms, maintain records, or disclose information to others. The intent was to require agencies to carefully consider the need for additional information before collecting it, thereby minimizing burdens. Once approved, the cost estimates are posted online and searchable by agency. Even I was a bit surprised to see the extent of the FCC‚Äôs information collection efforts, which seem disproportionately costly. According to OMB, as of the end of February, the FCC has 423 active collections demanding 457,355,706 responses each year requiring a total of 73,200,049 hours to complete at a total cost of $798,204,803. In short hand, that's 73 million hours and $800 million annually just to fill out FCC paperwork, and there is a decent chance that these figures are lowballed. That is well above the cost figures of several other major agencies, as seen below. Agency Total Cost of Active Information Collections Department of Education $305,014 Department of Housing & Urban Development $1,942,728 Department of Veterans Affairs $11,141,104 Department of Energy $49,550,308 Department of the Interior $178,634,533 Department of Agriculture $397,848,225 FCC $798,204,803 While I strongly believe in data driven decision making and the need to ensure accountability, I have to question how much of the existing information collection is truly justified. I‚Äôve observed that every new FCC policy seems to require a brand new data collection. And, once in place, the rules can live on long past their usefulness. Moreover, without sufficient coordination within the agency, the burdens can pile up without any clear understanding of the total burden on any given segment of the industry. For example, I have heard from small rural telephone companies that now have to make close to 100 filings with the FCC each year. That's a significant amount of time and resources that are being diverted away from delivering service to consumers. Last March, the Commission sought comment on eliminating several types of burdens on these providers, which I viewed as the tip of the iceberg. The Commission even observed that these small companies may be subject to duplicative sets of network outage reporting requirements and sought comment on whether to eliminate one set. Almost a year later, the Notice remains pending. In addition to acting quickly on these known problems, the agency should complete a holistic data review to determine which collections remain necessary, look at ways to streamline those collections, and eliminate those that are duplicative or unnecessary. I am also troubled that the Commission does not currently track burdens by industry segment or even by size. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires federal agencies to review regulations for their impact on small businesses and consider less burdensome alternatives. Therefore, in each rulemaking item, there is a lengthy appendix listing all of the types of small entities impacted by the Commission's action. I asked our Office of Communications Business Opportunities, which is the agency's small business liaison, for information on the total burdens on each type of small business regulated by the agency, as well as the number of times that the Commission considered but declined to make accommodations for small businesses. However, they were unable to provide the requested information because they do not keep track of it. In fact, the response was that it is not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, or any executive order. This explanation completely missed the point. These data points and other basic data should be available to help us understand the impact of the Commission's activities. Therefore, I recommend that, going forward, we require OCBO to begin tracking this information. At a minimum, the agency should be able to catalog and track the paperwork burdens imposed on small providers given that it is already required to calculate those costs for PRA and already specifies which small providers are impacted by rule changes for purposes of the RFA. Combining the two should not be too hard, and would be worth the effort. At the same time, the Commission should enthusiastically embrace ‚Äì whether required to do so or voluntarily ‚Äì the Administration‚Äôs Executive Order creating regulatory reform officers and agency regulatory reform task forces. The idea is simple: assemble dedicated people in each government agency to make recommendations to repeal or simplify existing regulations that are unnecessary, burdensome or harmful to the economy. While seemingly repetitive of efforts already underway, it has some unique proprieties that could generate new reform ideas not considered or explored before. In the end, it's a sound and worthy goal to provide strong and vibrant American industries to employee Americans and improve economic productivity. One of the first jobs of the new FCC task force should be to examine our paperwork burdens. *             *             * As I've said before, regulations impose costs on companies and, ultimately, consumers. We must be careful not to place undue burdens on companies whether in specific rulemakings, or as the product of cumulative Commission actions. By tracking and regularly reviewing the requirements we put on providers, we can better ensure that the costs we do impose are narrowly tailored and truly warranted.   [1] This is being done both informally on an ad-hoc basis and as part of the Commission‚Äôs biennial review obligations under Section 11 of the Communications Act. .

85	Springing Forward for the Public Interest: The FCC‚Äôs March Agenda	Ajit Pai	2017-03-02 13:45:00	1488487500.0	Chairman Pai with then-Governor Nikki Haley (left) and Captain Robert Johnson (center) at South Carolina field hearing. On March 23, the Federal Communications Commission will hold its monthly ‚Äúopen meeting,‚Äù which is the public session at which Commissioners vote on various proposals and orders. I wanted to let you know what we‚Äôll be voting on and why each matter is important. But first, a note on process. As you may remember, I started a pilot project last month to bring more openness and transparency to our agency. The FCC publicly released, three weeks in advance of the February 23 meeting, a proposal on Next Generation TV standard and an order on AM radio. Both the proposal and order were adopted unanimously at the February meeting.  I‚Äôm pleased to report that the initial stage of the pilot project was a success! We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the public. Accordingly, today the FCC is expanding the pilot project. We‚Äôre publicly releasing the draft text of all six matters that will be considered at our March open meeting. Allowing anyone, anywhere to see these documents publicly is another step towards shedding more sunlight on the FCC‚Äôs operations. After March 23, I expect that we‚Äôll be in a position to fully evaluate this pilot project and establish permanent procedures for the release of meeting items. Turning from process to substance, our March agenda is a full one. As I said, the FCC will be voting on six items. (One-pagers describing each of these items in greater detail will soon be made available on the Commission‚Äôs website.) Topping the list will be a proposal to combat the top source of consumer complaints to the FCC: robocalls. We‚Äôve all been there. You‚Äôre eating dinner or in the middle of watching your favorite show and you‚Äôre disturbed by the ring of a pre-recorded call. These calls are not just a nuisance; they‚Äôre often scams. For example, outlaw operators are posing as IRS agents and threatening people, particularly older Americans and other vulnerable populations, that if they don‚Äôt send them money, law enforcement will come after them. There are rules on the books prohibiting these unwanted calls, but scofflaws are finding creative ways to avoid getting caught. When U.S. consumers are receiving 2.4 billion robocalls a month, we need to do more. And by ‚Äúwe,‚Äù I mean the FCC, collaborating with the private sector. I‚Äôm grateful for the company leaders and consumer groups who teamed up in 2016 to form the Robocall Strike Force, which has been working to come up with solutions to this growing problem.  One of the issues the Task Force has singled out is caller ID spoofing. Through spoofing, someone calling from one number (555‚Äì1212) changes caller ID information to make it appear as though he‚Äôs calling from a different number (867‚Äì5309). Scammers and spammers use spoofing to disguise their identity, to trick consumers into answering unwanted calls, and to hide from authorities. And under the FCC‚Äôs current rules, which generally prevent call-blocking, there is not much that carriers can do to stop this. This must change. Under my proposal, the FCC would give providers greater leeway to block spoofed robocalls. Specifically, they could block calls that purport to be from unassigned or invalid phone numbers (there‚Äôs a database that keeps track of all phone numbers, and many of them aren‚Äôt assigned to a voice service provider or aren‚Äôt otherwise in use). There is no reason why any legitimate caller should be spoofing an unassigned or invalid phone number. It‚Äôs just a way for scammers to evade the law. The American people have long made it clear ‚Äî and industry, consumer groups, and government are unified behind them ‚Äî that they want unwanted robocalls to stop. This month, we‚Äôll hopefully take an important step toward combating this scourge. Now, to our second item. Whereas robocalls are ever-present, the problem of contraband cellphones in prisons ‚Äî that is, cellphones illegally being used by inmates ‚Äî is generally out-of-sight and too easily ignored. But the need for action is just as clear. As a Commissioner, I‚Äôve visited correctional institutions to learn first-hand about this issue. I‚Äôve been to a maximum security prison in Georgia and a minimum security unit in Massachusetts, among others. At each facility, I‚Äôve heard about the threat to public safety these devices pose. They‚Äôve been used to run drug operations from inside prisons. They‚Äôve been used for phone scams. And most seriously, they‚Äôve been used for violent purposes, including the targeting of prison guards and witnesses in pending court cases. Indeed, in South Carolina, I personally met Captain Robert Johnson, who was shot six times in his home as the result of a hit ordered through a contraband cellphone, but thankfully survived. Contraband cellphones are also used to blackmail inmates‚Äô relatives and ultimately hurt inmates. In one case, a Georgia inmate‚Äôs wife got a text message demanding $1,000. When she couldn‚Äôt pay the money, she received a picture of her husband with the word ‚ÄúRAT‚Äù carved into his forehead. To give you a sense of the scale of this issue, Georgia officials seized over 8,300 illegal cell phones in a recent year. That‚Äôs just one year‚Äôs haul in one state. In 2013, the FCC started to consider rules to spur the development of technological solutions to fight this problem. It‚Äôs high time to take action on that record, which is fully complete and robust. So the FCC will vote on reforms to facilitate the use of radio-based technologies to detect and block the use of contraband phones in these prisons and jails. And I‚Äôm asking my colleagues to allow public input on other solutions for addressing this pressing problem, including disabling devices and geo-fencing. Third, the FCC will help Americans with disabilities have better access to communications services. Video Relay Services are a vital real-time communications tool for deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans. For 15 years, VRS has enabled deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to call friends, family members, and others using American Sign Language (ASL) and a videophone, and to have their calls interpreted from signs to voice and vice versa. We‚Äôve heard from advocates about the need for improvements to VRS service. At our March meeting, I hope my colleagues will agree with me on addressing that need. For example, we‚Äôll seek to authorize a trial of specialized interpreters (say, those with particular skill in interpreting medical or technical terms). We‚Äôll also try to help those with disabilities comparison shop for VRS providers. And we‚Äôll aim to make video phone numbers available to hearing people who know ASL, so they can have direct-dialed video calls with deaf and hard-of-hearing consumers. These and other steps would better ensure that deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals have service that is functionally equivalent to voice services available to hearing individuals. Rounding out the March agenda will be new rules that will give cellular service providers greater flexibility to provide customers advanced broadband services; a plan to eliminate outdated reporting requirements for providers of international telecommunications services; and an order that would for the first time expand the Commission‚Äôs channel-sharing rules outside the context of the incentive auction, giving low power TV and TV translator stations more options to stay in business and continue broadcasting essential news and information to the public. I look forward to collaborating with my colleagues on the important issues that are teed up for the FCC‚Äôs March meeting. From helping protect Americans from unwanted robocalls to stopping the crime that results from inmates‚Äô use of contraband cellphones to aiding those with disabilities who simply wish to communicate more easily, we will be working hard to advance the public interest.	{0: {'username': 'William Frazier', 'date_epoch': 1488855420.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-03-06 19:57:00', 'response_content': 'Mr. Pai, thank you for your clearly energetic, organized, and action-oriented work.

86	OET Authorizes First LTE-U devices	Julius Knapp	2017-02-22 12:30:00	1487791800.0	Today the Office of Engineering and Technology authorized the first LTE-U (LTE for unlicensed) devices in the 5 GHz band.  This action follows a collaborative industry process to ensure co-existence of LTE-U with Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices operating in the 5 GHz band. The Commission‚Äôs provisions for unlicensed devices are designed to prevent harmful interference to radio communications services and stipulate that these devices must accept any harmful interference they receive. Industry has developed various standards within the framework of these rules such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee that are designed to coexist in shared spectrum.  These and other unlicensed technologies have been deployed extensively and are used by consumers and industry for a wide variety of applications. LTE-U is a specification that was developed and supported by a group of companies within the LTE-U Forum.  LTE-U and Wi-Fi stakeholders worked together under the auspices of the Wi-Fi Alliance to develop co-existence guidelines and an evaluation test plan that was released last fall. The LTE-U devices that were certified today have been tested to show they meet all of the FCC‚Äôs rules.  We understand that the LTE-U devices were evaluated successfully under the co-existence test plan.  However, this is not an FCC requirement and similar to conformity testing for private sector standards the co-existence test results are not included in the FCC‚Äôs equipment certification records.  The circumstances in this instance were unique.

87	A Modified Delegated Authority Proposal	Michael O'Rielly	2017-02-22 11:26:00	1487787960.0	I have made the case previously that the Commission delegates way too many substantive decisions to Bureau staff, usurping the role and obligations of duly appointed and confirmed Commissioners.  Consider that in 2016 I only voted on 167 items, but almost nine times as many were decided on delegated authority.  While some people found my points compelling, the prior Chairman‚Äôs staff objected, arguing that changing the practice would lead to chaos and dilatory tactics.  In the spirit of compromise, I moved away from the idea that an individual Commissioner should have the right to effectively ‚Äúundelegate‚Äù any item and call for a full Commission vote.  Instead, I proffered a modified structure during closed-door discussions with representatives of the then-Chairman and other Commissioners‚Äô offices.  While this was ultimately rejected at the time, it seems appropriate to see if it may be agreeable in this new Commission. The heart of my revised delegated authority proposal is an attempt to achieve balance between the need to allow Commissioners to have greater say in the workings of the Commission and preventing process abuses and unnecessary delays.  Here are its main components: Advanced Warning ‚Äì Consistent with my previous recommendation, except for the most routine matters, Commissioners should be provided no less than 48 hours to review an item that is to be decided by Bureau staff under delegated authority.  Certain Bureau-level items, such as universal service decisions, are already provided to Commissioners 48 hours prior to release for informational purposes, but, under the past administration, this practice was not uniformly applied across the agency or even within the same Bureau.  This reasonable practice allows a sufficient timeframe for Commissioners to determine whether the proposed decision should be decided by the full Commission.  Further, it doesn't delay an item so long as to jeopardize the ability of the Commission to take swift action when necessary. Request by Two or More Commissioners ‚Äì On any given matter, it is possible that any one Commissioner could be troubled by the substance or process of an item.  Additionally, the culmination of numerous matters could influence a Commissioner to demand full Commission votes on everything under the sun, which, it was argued, could cause delay and endless votes by Commissioners.  While I wouldn't necessarily have a personal problem voting more often, I can see why some may find a one-Commissioner trigger problematic.  Accordingly, the threshold to bring an item up to the floor for a vote should be set at two Commissioners.  Quite frankly, if a Commissioner can't convince at least one other to join their cause, we should move forward posthaste. Time Constraint ‚Äì A concern was raised that having two Commissioners as the proper threshold may not necessarily provide a sufficient barrier to excessive or needless delays.  As a remedy, I propose that any item that is removed from delegated authority under these procedures must be voted by the full Commission within seven calendar days or five business days (although I might be willing to live with a shorter deadline).  This should ensure that items previously set for delegated authority, but then subsequently elevated, will be addressed quickly.  Automatic Approval if Delayed ‚Äì Under my proposal, in those instances (if ever) when a requesting office does not vote by the deadline, the item would be ‚Äì at the Chairman‚Äôs prerogative ‚Äì either released as approved by the full Commission (assuming the other offices voted to approve) or sent back to the Bureau for immediate issuance on delegated authority.  In other words, a requesting Commissioner that does not vote by the deadline risks the possibility that their failure to act would be deemed an approval and the item would be disposed of by the full Commission.  An added benefit is that this would effectively shorten the procedural path to obtain a final Commission decision by eliminating the need for stakeholders to ‚Äúappeal‚Äù the Bureau-level item to the Commission by filing an application for review. Fixing the overuse of delegated authority should be high on our list of priorities as the new Commission examines internal process reform.  Hopefully, my proposal finds support from those seeking to improve the efficiency of the Commission‚Äôs procedures and those worried about improper constraints on the ability of the Commission to function. 	{0: {'username': 'Michael Marcus', 'date_epoch': 1487790540.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-02-22 12:09:00', 'response_content': 'Great suggestions, but let me add some more to help improve FCC prodictivity AND accountability to commissioenrs:'}}
88	Needed: A Universal FCC Deadline Policy	Michael O'Rielly	2017-02-08 15:35:00	1486593300.0	For Commission rules and procedures to be truly effective, everyone needs to know with a certain level of confidence what will happen if applicable deadlines are missed.  Not only does this not exist today, but the Commission‚Äôs inconsistency with how it responds to late filings borders on arbitrary and capricious.  To rectify, I suggest it is time to establish a universally-applied policy that, from now on, everyone is expected to either comply with all applicable deadlines or face the consequences.  Let‚Äôs remove the ambiguity and wide disparity of approaches once and for all.      Depending on the particular issue and the specific bureau, a provider or individual subject to Commission rules can see vast differences in how the deadlines are treated and enforced.  The simple fact is that some bureaus are far more forgiving about timeliness than others.  This makes little sense and unfairly penalizes those industry sectors that do not receive such benevolence.  Certain bureaus have dismissed a petition for reconsideration filed one day late, are more than willing to cancel Commission-issued licenses that are not in compliance, and exclude auction participants that miss a deadline at the drop of a hat.  For instance, in the auction context, an applicant whose down payment was a day late was disqualified from acquiring auction licenses and assessed a default payment.  And, a licensee whose renewal application was three days late lost two wireless public safety licenses.[1]   On the other hand, some bureaus seem to go out of their way to make late filings seem as our mistake and work with applicants to rectify their omission, making them completely whole.  Take for instance, WAJM, an FM station in New Jersey, where the Commission renewed the authorization, even though the licensee failed to file the required paperwork until four years after the conclusion of its term.  The item states, ‚Äúthe Commission consistently has allowed broadcast station licenses to be renewed even though the license renewal application was filed after the license term expired.  Adopting a contrary position in this case, without any prior notice to the Board, would violate the Board‚Äôs due process rights.‚Äù  Given the circumstances, I supported the item‚Äôs outcome, but why was it allowed to come to this?  Similarly, the Wireline Competition Bureau‚Äôs recent policy change permits USF high-cost recipients to miss interim buildout deadlines, cure at a later date but still receive 100 percent of any withheld funds, and missing a final milestone and failing to cure within 12 months results in a penalty of only ten percent of the high-cost support.  This should strike everyone as too forgiving for missing their commitments to the Commission and, more importantly, to consumers.  Moreover, consider the fact that failure to timely file information with the Commission, including certifications, now results in a small base penalty and a pro rata reduction in the associated high-cost support.  This doesn‚Äôt mean to suggest that special circumstances do not exist, from time to time, to justify missing a deadline.  Things happen in the real world, outside the control of the affected party, which may prevent complying with specific requirements by a set date.  That‚Äôs why the Commission‚Äôs rules include waiver authority.  Exercising thoughtful and judicial waiver authority, however, is a far cry from having multiple and competing standards, practices or understandings about what happens when a deadline is missed.  In fact, the lax deadline approach means that, in some circumstances, there is no need to get to the waiver stage, since missing a deadline is ultimately acceptable in one form or another.     Let me be clear that I am not blaming any particular bureau or staff for the current state of affairs.  That‚Äôs a bit like debating how the boat sank when you‚Äôre surrounded by sharks.  Instead, let‚Äôs focus on correcting the situation going forward.  This means showing leadership on the Eighth Floor; we have an overarching view of the Commission‚Äôs deadlines and how they are being enforced.  So, if we take that knowledge and compose a firm policy on deadlines, it would improve Commission functionality, bring clarity to regulated entities and help stabilize our overall enforcement mechanisms.        Enforcement Amnesty Window The past Commission‚Äôs approach to enforcement matters ‚Äì one generally based on optics and achieving headlines‚Äì discouraged regulated entities from self-reporting any instances where they may be out of compliance.  And who can blame them?  Too many times that particular Commission used information reported by companies ‚Äì those trying to do the right thing ‚Äì against them.  When enforcement turns into a game of gotcha, there really isn't much desire by parties to voluntarily poke their heads up. Beyond reestablishing a sound enforcement approach, I suggest it‚Äôs time to consider creating a short, defined window for companies to report instances in which they are not in compliance with Commission rules.  Call it an Enforcement Amnesty Window in order to get everyone back within bounds of our rules.  Such an amnesty period would be short and shouldn‚Äôt apply to intentional non-compliance or those violations that resulted in direct harm to consumers.  What I envision as being eligible for relief are the same type of licensing and deadline errors as discussed above and other minor licensing matters that can be easily rectified. Such an approach is not without precedent.  In 2003, the Commission held a 60-day amnesty window for unregistered antenna structures.  In that instance, the Commission determined after an audit that 442 communications towers sites were not in compliance with our antenna structure registration requirements.  Applicants had a chance to fix their information on file or face future enforcement actions.    *             *             * As it stands now, the Commission is unintentionally favoring some parties over others through its disparate treatment of its deadlines.  Moreover, combining a short amnesty window to rectify current instances where licensees may not be in compliance with the implementation of firm deadlines, going forward, would help restore administrative certainty, transparency, parity, and confidence in our enforcement process.   [1] In fact, the Commission has a policy for wireless services that permits some leniency if an application to renew a license with an accompanying waiver is 30 days late, but expressly states that anything filed beyond that will be subject to a stricter review and will not be routinely granted.  Regardless of when the corrective application is filed, a licensee could be subject to enforcement action.

89	My Personal Story in Search of #PhoneJustice	Mignon Clyburn	2017-02-07 12:12:00	1486494720.0	"It is 9:10 a.m. on Monday, February 6, 2017, and I am sitting in the courtroom without my cellphones. Like many who find themselves disconnected from their mobile device(s) for any length of time, I feel extremely uncomfortable and detached from the rest of the world. But whatever my discomfort, it pales in comparison to the day-to-day economic and personal torture felt by millions who remain on the wrong side of the economic justice divide and struggle to stay in touch with incarcerated loved ones. Innocent or guilty, too often poor and disenfranchised, millions of mostly black and brown families suffer mightily. They suffer because we who are sworn to serve them have turned our backs on the nation's most vulnerable communities. We are quick to judge and do not think twice as we ignore the plight of the families, friends and representatives of those imprisoned, but awaiting their day in court, and the millions of others who have been sentenced and are serving time: rightly, wrongly or unfairly. But the most callous indictment of us all, is how little we appear to care about the 2.7 million children, the ailing grandmothers and the other often-destitute family members who pay a heavy price just for picking up the phone and keeping in touch. But my biggest discomfort of the day, as I wait for the court to come to order, is my struggle with my feelings about my (former) state colleagues, who are steadfast in defending their positions against the FCC when it comes to inmate calling primarily on jurisdictional grounds. For years, I have not only asked, but begged them not to sit idly by as the people they were sworn to defend suffer mightily from a clearly dysfunctional inmate calling services marketplace. Most of them have elected to do nothing, but are quick to stand boldly and shout loudly about just how far they think we have overstepped our regulatory bounds. ""Do your job,"" I scream silently this morning. ""If you'd bothered to act, we would not even be here today!"" And at the risk of further straining some long-standing relationships, I will retire for the evening still asking: ""why won't you just act?!"" The minute hand on the analog clock is about to approach the 9:30 a.m. hour and as I sit in a sea of blue, gray and black suits, I notice something remarkable and striking: The people poised to defend their positions this morning as well as those in the courtroom (with the exception of one judge, two employees and me) do not look remotely similar to the majority of the millions whose lives hang in the balance today. Calm down, I say to myself. Calm down, Mignon, and pray that just this one time, the angels of justice will smile brightly on us this morning. ""Oyez, oyez, oyez,"" I hear the court clerk announce.

90	Setting the Record Straight on the Digital Divide	Ajit Pai	2017-02-07 12:45:00	1486496700.0	In my first remarks as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission to the agency‚Äôs terrific staff, I stressed that one of my top priorities would be to close the digital divide ‚Äî the gap between ‚Äúthose who can use cutting-edge communications services and those who do not.‚Äù I‚Äôve explored that divide for myself in places like Barrow, Alaska; Los Angeles, California; Clay, West Virginia; and many more places. Now that I‚Äôm at the helm of the agency, I‚Äôm determined to address it. We‚Äôve already hit the ground running. In the first vote under my Chairmanship, I worked with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Senator Charles Schumer, Representative Chris Collins, and other officials to direct $170 million in federal funding to build out broadband in upstate New York to places that are currently unserved. In the second week of my Chairmanship, I shared with my colleagues and set votes for February 23 on two detailed proposals for closing the digital divide. One of them would direct billions of dollars ‚Äî with a ‚Äúb‚Äù ‚Äî over a decade toward making sure that all parts of this country have 4G LTE coverage. (Currently, there are too many gaps where your phone displays ‚ÄúNo Service‚Äù ‚Äî as I saw for myself during a recent drive from Wichita, Kansas to Des Moines, Iowa.) The other would allocate nearly $2 billion ‚Äî again with a ‚Äúb‚Äù ‚Äî for advancing fixed broadband service across the country. With more connectivity, more Americans than ever before will have digital opportunity. Finally, I‚Äôve engaged with Members of Congress about my proposal for Gigabit Opportunity Zones. Under this infrastructure plan, the government would use tax incentives to encourage the deployment of ultra-fast broadband in lower-income areas as small as an urban city block and as large as a rural county. It would also encourage entrepreneurs to take advantage of these next-generation networks by creating jobs in those areas. Gigabit Opportunity Zones would enable Americans to become participants in, rather than spectators of, the digital economy. They would be a powerful solution to the digital divide. I hope our elected officials will give the idea serious consideration. * * * At the same time, one recent FCC decision has caused some controversy of late. Specifically, some have asked why the agency‚Äôs Wireline Competition Bureau issued an order reconsidering nine companies‚Äô eligibility to participate in the Lifeline program, which aims to help make voice and broadband more affordable to low-income Americans. It‚Äôs vital that low-income Americans have access to communications services, including broadband Internet, which Lifeline helps to achieve. Unfortunately, many of the media headlines have sensationalized this story and given some an entirely misleading impression of what is going on. Indeed, based on the some of the coverage, one would think that we had ended Lifeline broadband subsidies altogether. So I want to set the record straight about the modest steps we have taken and why we have taken them. First, our action only impacted 9 of the over 900 providers participating in the Lifeline program. In other words, 99% of the companies participating in the program are not affected at all. Second, the applications of these nine providers to participate in the program have not been rejected. They simply remain pending at the Commission. Third, all but one of the newly designated providers covered by the order do not yet have any customers. Fourth, the prior FCC disregarded the well-established process for approving applications like these. As the National Tribal Telecommunications Association pointed out, several of the providers had never coordinated their applications with Tribes, despite an FCC rule clearly requiring them to do so. These Tribal representatives thus requested that the designations be reversed. Moreover, two of the designated providers were approved in the middle of the 30-day period for public comment ‚Äî that is, before the public even had a chance to weigh in on the designation. Whatever one thinks of the merits of these applications, that was plainly improper. Fifth, many of these designations were approved in the last days of the last Administration (two days before Inauguration Day), over the objections of two of the four Commissioners, despite the fact that the FCC‚Äôs congressional oversight committees had requested that the Commission not take controversial actions during the transition between Administrations (consistent with the request from those same committees during the Republican-to-Democrat transition in 2008‚Äì09). Thus, a majority of Commissioners never supported approval of these designations. Sixth, every dollar that is spent on subsidizing somebody who doesn‚Äôt need the help by definition does not go to someone who does. That means that the Commission needs to make sure that there are strong safeguards against waste, fraud, and abuse before expanding the program to new providers. But consider: The National Verifier ‚Äî which is a new database that is intended to verify eligibility to participate in the Lifeline program ‚Äî does not currently exist and will not start operating until the end of 2017. Further, it is not scheduled to cover all states until 2019. My investigation last year into these matters revealed serious weaknesses in federal safeguards, allowing providers to indiscriminately override checks that are supposed to prevent wasteful and fraudulent activities. (These checks include common-sense steps like verifying the identity of would-be Lifeline recipients.) From October 2014 until June 2016, wireless resellers had overridden such safeguards 4,291,647 times in total. The investigation also uncovered other loopholes, including one that let a company claim subsidies for approximately 22,000 phantom subscribers each month in the state of Michigan. Seventh and finally, there is a serious question as to whether the FCC has the legal authority to designate Lifeline providers or whether such designations must be made by state governments, as has long been the norm. Indeed, well before the prior FCC issued these last-minute designations, state regulatory agencies had filed a substantial legal challenge to the entire process of the FCC designating Lifeline Broadband Providers, arguing that it‚Äôs unlawful, and the FCC itself recently asked the court for additional time to consider this issue. For instance, Section 214 of the Communications Act explicitly says that states must make designations for purposes of allowing companies to receive Lifeline subsidies. The FCC has repeatedly, and for many years, recognized states‚Äô primary role in this area. By preempting the states‚Äô role in certification, the federal designations appear to run afoul of this legal framework. Putting the designations on hold gives the FCC the chance to make sure the process is legally defensible and to avoid potentially stranding customers if the courts ultimately deem the process unlawful. Hyperbolic headlines always attract more attention than mundane truths. For example, a story detailing how the FCC was undertaking further review of the eligibility of 1% of Lifeline providers wouldn‚Äôt generate too many clicks. That‚Äôs long been the case in policy debates, of course. But at the end of the day, my focus has been ‚Äî and will continue to be so long as I have the privilege of serving as the Chairman of the FCC ‚Äî doing everything within the FCC‚Äôs power to close the digital divide. I am committed, both by belief and by law, to ensuring that the agency is focused on the 21st century version of our 20th century charge: ‚Äúto make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.‚Äù We‚Äôve made progress over the past few weeks, and we‚Äôll do more in the time to come to benefit all Americans.

91	Federal Broadband Infrastructure Spending: Potential Pitfalls	Michael O'Rielly	2017-02-01 14:00:00	1485982800.0	Much discussion in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere is occurring over whether there should be an expansive infrastructure spending and policy bill.  For those in the communications space, this has spurred interest in inserting broadband-related infrastructure provisions within such a legislative vehicle.[1]  While sound telecom policy provisions that promote infrastructure buildout could make sense, I would argue that policymakers should be leery of new communications infrastructure spending, as the last thing consumers or businesses need is an encore of the market distortions caused by the last Federal government economic stimulus efforts.  For the sake of efficiency and soundness, if new government money has to be included for broadband, it should be done in a way that does not harm competition in the marketplace, prevents bureaucrats from picking winners and losers, is technology agnostic, distributes resources in an effective and efficient manner, and does not undermine the FCC‚Äôs universal service high-cost program. It only seems appropriate to start by recognizing the positive state of U.S. broadband.  While some disparage the progress that has been made, the fact is that broadband is widely available in most parts of America, certainly at a level to meet the actual demands of users.  As the FCC‚Äôs own reporting showed using 2015 data, ninety percent of Americans have broadband access at speeds of 25 Mbps or better, and it has only improved since then.[2]  That doesn‚Äôt mean we should rest on our laurels, but it does mean that we should salute the work already done by private broadband companies and address any barriers preventing more extensive deployments, including reducing regulatory burdens.  It also means that we should redouble our efforts to build out to areas without service or lacking sufficient service today through market-based mechanisms.  Sadly, I have visited parts of America that are without any option for broadband service.  Getting to work on the FCC‚Äôs Remote Areas Fund, as I have called for over the past three years, would be a step in the right direction.  Our current broadband successes also mean that we should discard old arguments that are not based on reality or serve as a distraction to our true mission.  For instance, continuing to debate the status of U.S. broadband compared to other nations, especially based on misleading rankings like those of the OECD,[3] is inappropriate.  Simply examining our nation‚Äôs vast geography should remind everyone of the difficulty of serving all populated parts.  America isn‚Äôt some peninsula or archipelago with a saturation or population density of 100s per square inch. In all seriousness, while a portion of America‚Äôs entrepreneurial and individualistic spirit comes from the vast open land available, especially in the west, this makes broadband deployment to all corners more challenging.  According to the OECD‚Äôs latest statistics, South Korea‚Äôs fixed broadband penetration subscriptions per 100 inhabitants was ranked fifth compared to the U.S. ranking of seventeenth,[4] but Korea‚Äôs population density in 2015 was 519 per square kilometer compared to our 35.[5]  Thus, artificial comparisons to other nations of different sizes and terrains doesn‚Äôt serve much value without understanding the contextual situations we face as a nation.  Moreover, broadband measurements have been based on contrived FCC definitions and unproductive thresholds.  It simply isn‚Äôt true that every user within a city, town, village, or hamlet must have or demands broadband at a certain speed, such as downloads of 25/50/100 Mbps.  Examining closely the assumptions used by the Commission to establish its benchmark of ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù broadband highlights its detachment from reality and its intention to use the benchmark for political and regulatory purposes.  More importantly, focusing on artificial speeds diverts attention and resources from establishing service to those lacking any broadband service.  The outcry for things like ultra-high speed service in certain areas means longer waits for those who have no access or still rely on dialup service, as providers rush to serve the denser and more profitable areas that seek upgrades to this level.  Today, ultra-fast residential service is a novelty and good for marketing, but the tiny percentage of people using it cannot drive our policy decisions.  Instead, we should strive to ensure that broadband of a realistic speed and quality is available for as many as possible, knowing it will be far exceeded in most circumstances. Fundamentally, our broadband policy has been and should continue to be based on private sector companies continuing to build out their networks to meet consumer needs.  Unlike government entities, the private sector has the technical knowhow and experience to build and operate complex communications systems.  The surest way to continue the current trajectory of progress is to remove barriers to entry for new technologies or deployment.  As I have testified before Congress previously, some states, localities and Tribal governments are making it more difficult to deploy broadband throughout our nation.  Evidence and experience shows that a number of these entities are imposing extensive and costly process reviews or trying to extract huge payments from communications companies for the ‚Äúright‚Äù to serve their residents.  I am hopeful the Commission will continue its work to strike these down.  Despite best efforts to date, consumers in some areas in America do not have sufficient broadband.  In these areas where there is no business case to provide broadband, the law provides the Commission with the responsibility and the duty to take remedial action.  To facilitate this obligation, the Commission operates subsidy programs by which providers are given financial resources obtained via fees from consumers as an incentive to serve less profitable areas.  The Commission‚Äôs extensive work has created relatively cost-efficient distribution mechanisms, including reverse auctions, based on the best data available and taking into account appropriate factors to ensure that the subsidies are provided only where, when and at the level actually needed.  While not perfect by any stretch, the Commission‚Äôs universal service high-cost program defensibly allocates resources in a relatively well-reasoned and rational way.  At the current time, the Commission distributes approximately $4.5 billion annually for these purposes, and projects in the pipeline will dramatically improve overall broadband access in harder to reach areas in the coming months and years ahead.  Moreover, the FCC‚Äôs high-cost program is oversubscribed compared to its budget, which is appropriately tied to how much we can extract from consumers, meaning that there is room to add additional funding that would lead to further deployment gains.  The good work being done by the private sector and the Commission has not prevented some from advocating for expending additional Federal dollars for broadband, hopefully by providing additional resources to private companies to expand their reach and enter new territories (and not funding government networks).  While seemingly helpful, there are serious potential drawbacks to this action, especially if it is done in a haphazard way.  Here are just a few of the major issues and problems: Harms to Private Sector ‚Äì In countless meetings over the last three years, I have heard about the harmful effects of the Obama Administration‚Äôs economic stimulus legislation, especially the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program and Broadband Initiatives Program (BTOP & BIP).  While supporters point to miles of fiber laid or anchor institutions connected, they fail to mention what this funding did to the competitors in the immediate and surrounding areas.  When one provider received special funding, it distorted the ability of non-recipients to operate, pay off debt, raise capital, and satisfy consumer interest.  In other words, artificially propping up select companies impacted the ability of others to compete, including growing their networks to unserved or underserved areas, and that doesn‚Äôt even include a critique of where grants were provided to overbuild existing providers.  With areas completely unserved or in need of upgrades, it makes little sense to direct federal dollars to fund competition.     Overpaying and Over Subsidization ‚Äì At its core, the Commission‚Äôs high-cost program is designed to limit any subsidy provided to broadband companies to only what is absolutely needed to promote access.  The institution of reverse auctions uses market forces to get providers to compete ‚Äì thereby driving down the subsidy costs ‚Äì for particular areas.  On the contrary, grant programs or loan subsidies do not induce any competitive pressure.  This means the Federal government overpays for broadband deployment in these scenarios.  Lack of Coordination ‚Äì Experience from the 2009 stimulus showed that insufficient coordination was done with the FCC by the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture as they created and operated their programs.  That means that, as bureaucrats were preparing to distribute multi-billions of dollars, they had little to no understanding of the prior and future commitments made by the Commission or how their programs would fit together with the Commission‚Äôs data intensive high-cost program.  In the end, the Commission was left to piece together the remnants of what was done by the other agencies in order to prevent duplication and address those areas still in need.  Bureaucrats Picking Winners & Losers ‚Äì Application-based programs use highly-questionable selective criteria (e.g., points system) combined with human intervention to determine what projects to fund.  This allows non-efficient factors to influence the outcome and cultivates an environment for political gamesmanship.  At a time when so much focus is on reducing undue or improper involvement by D.C. lobbyists and politicians, shouldn‚Äôt there be equal concern that any new broadband programs aren‚Äôt monopolized by the well-connected?  Technology Discrimination ‚Äì The Commission has spent the last 18 months ensuring that its program does not discriminate against any technology able to serve consumers. Unfortunately, many broadband programs are designed to be fiber first or fiber only and provide preferences to ensure other technologies do not win any funding or serve any consumers.  This myopic view ignores the development of other technology capabilities and allowances for terrain. Dragging fiber to the top of every mountain may not make any sense in terms of cost, time to build, safety of installers and long term survivability against the surrounding elements.  Alternatively, fixed wireless broadband or satellite may be the most appropriate solution. Instead of reinventing the wheel, if ‚Äì and that's a big if ‚Äì additional Federal broadband spending is deemed important and appropriate, I would argue that such funding should be directed into the Commission‚Äôs existing high-cost subsidy program. Because the program is oversubscribed within the current budget there is room to inject funding without causing dramatic changes or jeopardizing its operation.  In addition, the high-cost program can be extended quickly with existing agency personnel, resources and oversight, whereas creating new programs within other agencies would require rebuilding that infrastructure and accountability, adding time and expense.  In short, increasing the allocation with other resources would allow greater broadband expansion in a timely and more cost efficient manner, and with less influence peddling.
