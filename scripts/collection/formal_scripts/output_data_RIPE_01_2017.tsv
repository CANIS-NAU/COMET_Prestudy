To find out, you could connect a switch between the probe and the router  and use another computer to take a look at the router advertisements.

I could I manually assign an IPv6 address to the probe (22382)?  What I can’t get my head around is how to directly manage or query [in the sense of managing it, not measurements] the probe.  I have an IPv4 address for it, so I can send it packets, but if it has a SSH service, I certainly wouldn’t have a password much less a key.  There is no reason I can see keeping the probe from setting up an IPv6 address.  On the machines I’ve looked (at least one MacAir and one wired MacMini), IPv6 is apparently fully functional in the home network.  I don’t think it is a network environment problem, although, prior to July last year IPv6 worked and I did swap out some CPE equipment at the time IPv6 stopped working. In July  I went from a mundane cable modem bridge in front of a NATting WIFI router to a new cable modem which I am running in bridge mode in front of the same NATing WIFI router.  This switch did start the IPv6 problems for the probe.  What would help is asking the probe what it sees, hence the need for something like management console access.  BTW, The SOS History lists AAAA queries but nothing about responses.  For 18 April, it shows “no-usb” but for 19 April, that’s cleared.  This just confuses me (I did replace the usb stick a few months ago), I can’t tell if the usb is still an issue.  I keep staring at the log and it doesn’t seem to tell me anything.  This is on   https://atlas.ripe.net/probes/22382/#tab-network   PS - As far as the probe’s name ""Looks like something Apple would sell”, this comes from a question on a form when I registered the probe that asked for a description to it.  And that’s what I thought best described the probe, didn’t realize this would become the name. ;)'}}"

13	[atlas] Overuse of software probes	Grzegorz Ponikierski A	1648782940.0	2022-03-31 20:15:40	Hello all!Software probes is great improvement for Atlas environment and it made deployments so much easier and more scalable. One of my probes is also software probe on Raspberry Pi. However, me and my team noticed that sometimes software probes are overused and make measurements more cumbersome to interpret. For example we found that there 4 software probes in AWS Johannesburg [1] and 15 software probes in Hostinger Sao Paulo [2]. That's total overkill. These 15 probes in Hostinger Sao Paulo is 21% of all connected probes in Brazil. All of them delivers practically the same results so without additional data filtering (which is not easy) they can dramatically skew final results for Brazil.With this I would like to open discussion how to handle this situation. Please share your thoughts about these questions:  *   How can we standardize data filtering for such case?  *   How to proactively and automatically detect overuse of probes?  *   How can we encourage software probes hosts to avoid deployments in data centers which are already covered by Atlas?  *   How to give incentives to deploy probes in data centers without existing probes?[1] 4 software probes inside AWS Johannesburg:1000707100139710020661002632[2] 15 software probes inside Hostinger Sao Paulo100355410035551003556100355710035581003559100356010035611003562100356310035641003565100356610035671003568Regards,Grzegorz Ponikierski	"{0: {'username': 'Andreas Härpfer', 'date_epoch': 1648784617.0, 'date_ymd': '2022-03-31 20:43:37', 'response_content': 'Of course I am wildly guessing here, but the 15 probes in Hostinger Sao Paulo actually look a bit fishy to me.

If you also somehow take ASN size into account … 100 probes in the ASN of Deutsche Telekom make a lot more sense than 15 probes within the same /24.

I\'m not sure what data filtering you have in mind, but I know for sure  that richer _probe selection_ filters would help for my use-cases.  First, the current probe selection options I\'m aware of are:  (web wizard) - Geo name - ASN # filter - IP filter - Probe # filter  (web ""manual"" selection) - Type (mandatory) - Area (mandatory) - Number of probes (mandatory) - Include tags - Exclude tags  Proposal for new filters options: - Spread selection evenly across geo locations, max. N probes location - Spread selection evenly across ASNs, max. N probes per ASN - Spread selection across IP subnets, max. N probes per IP subnet  I imagine that these three should work as intersection with the other  filter (and themselves). I.e. it should allow to specify: - location = BR - max 2 probes per ASN - max 1 probe per subnet  Right now I\'m trying to do that by manually selecting probe IDs when I  need to, but obviously that does not scale.

One of them is calculating how similar probes are,  and then using this in probe selection (ie. use probes that are as  dissimilar as possible). For your particular use case, the 15 software  probes in Sao Paolo would likely be 100% similar to each other, which  can be taken into account with probe selection (or in the data analysis  if you already took measurements).  I have some prototype code for this laying around, I will see if we can  produce something useful out of this.  We are currently also collaborating with some talented researchers on  structurally looking into the bias of measurement infrastructures (see  https://labs.ripe.net/author/pavlos_sermpezis/bias-in-internet-measurement-infrastructure/  ). I hope some of the future results of that will also help with  estimating and dealing with all kinds of measurement biases.  kind regards, Emile Aben  On 2022-03-31 20:15, Ponikierski, Grzegorz via ripe-atlas wrote: > > Hello all! > > Software probes is great improvement for Atlas environment and it made  > deployments so much easier and more scalable.

I believe we should keep incentivising (for the lack of a better  word) ""benevolent"" probe hosts - ie. if someone would like to host a  probe, either hw or sw, then they should be able to do so and enjoy the  benefits. Having said this, with the hw probe distribution we prioritise  yet-uncovered networks. This is much harder to do with sw probes...  2. We should dis-incentivise ""farming"", if that happens. The issue is  that we can only recognise this once it happens. Coming up with hard  policies on how to regulate this in advance is not easy, but one can  come up with some guidelines on how to recognise such cases and what to  do with them when they are found.   There\'s of course a benefit in having multiple probes in a network, and  presumably the bigger said network is the more probes it could have.  Surely constructs like CGNATs make all kinds of corner cases...   I\'m very happy to see proposals on how to improve the built-in probe  selection process. We\'ll evaluate these and of course implement ones  that make sense within the system. At the end of the day there will  always be cases that can only be done ""manually"", ie. the user selecting  particular probes by whatever criteria they want to use.

I’m launching experiments in pairs from the web interface. I would like to retrieve the probes selected randomly in one experiment for another measurement that takes place at the same time. My problem is that it takes time to show the measurement I created in the list of ""my measurements"". Even when all measurements are shown in the list of all ""my measurements"", the creation interface does not find all these measurement ids. So I cannot retrieve the probes I need.Is there an access problem to the measurement DB or am I doing something wrong?Cristel"	{}

It could also be a combination of multiple indicators. IP addresses, SNI, TTL, but here it seems more likely to be the first one.  This could be proven: put a self-signed cert of www.facebook.com on a server and try to repeat the IP address based check.

This is indeed what I could see last week. For instance, providing a SNI of Instagram.com (1 week ago) would get through, providing an SNI of foo.com would fail verification (expected), providing an empty value for SNI would also fail with client hello read timeout. When no SNI is provided, the default cert is for *.Facebook.com.  Asking for Facebook.com against a Cloudflare IP was also showing the read timeout. Request to CF IP with empty SNI would successfully return a cert.  > This suggest that either SNI filtering is done on return client hello so it can catch the default cert when no SNI is provided, or that there is a combination of dropping outgoing client hello with specific name + dropping empty SNI to specific ranges, or a combination of both.  The CF example makes he believe it is the second option.  I will send example probes when I get to a device with a keyboard.

Jaewon Kim	1645257173.0	2022-02-19 00:52:53	"Hello, List!First of all, this is my first time posting to any kind of mailing list, so apologies if I did something wrong. Please let me know if so.I'm having this weird issue where 'My Atlas' page showing wrong info for ""total daily income"" (around 2x of what I'm actually getting).As you can see above, Atlas is reporting that this specific probe is earning 64K a day, and the total income is around 615K. However, if I see the actual credits page,None of my probes are actually earning that much. Plus, the hourly income is 13.7K, which sums up to around 330K/day.This isn't a big issue to be honest, but just got curious (and confused) with it.If anyone knows a fix for it, or why this is happening, it would be great :)Thank you!Best regards,Jaewon."	{}

It’s open source, free and available at https://www.perfsonar.net/.  The CERN experiment infrastructure around the world has ~1000 perfSONAR nodes deployed, for example.  It can be used on everything from Raspberry Pi for Gigabit links up to 100G Ethernet links using well-specified and tuned servers.  It runs continuous loss and latency tests, and (by default) throughput tests to configured destinations every 6 hours.  Its pScheduler component ensures throughput tests are scheduled to be non conflicting.  Such tests can use for example iperf2, iperf3 or Ethr.   There was a talk yesterday about perfSONAR on Pi devices and with Docker - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbYpK2PtVnI, and a more general perfSONAR talk at UKNOF in December - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj8_cLLDQ2g.

As part of your evaluation on the distribution method of \'software probes\'.  The plus regarding snap packages is they are automatically updated without the need for user actions. (The auto-update functionality being a core design principle with the snap package manager.)

Currently, this is indeed the case. It is however in our plans to  support an IPv6-only option.  The biggest changes needed are in our monitoring, the installation  process and our deploy as anchor process.  Technically, AFAIK, there are no roadblocks anymore.

41	[atlas] Inconsistencies in anchor API and measurements	Malte Appel	1636990364.0	2021-11-15 08:32:44	Hi everyone,sorry in advance for the long mail.tl;dr: Anchor API and UI give inconsistent results. Some anchor meshmeasurements could be fixed, some might target non-anchors. Not sure what to doabout it.I am currently working a lot with RIPE Atlas and recently wanted to use theanchors and their mesh measurements in particular. I wanted to answer two simplequeries:   1. Get a list of all active anchors   2. Get a list of all active anchor mesh and probe measurements (traceroute,      for my particular use case)However, while trying to answer these queries, I stumbled upon quite someinconsistencies, depending on which interface / API is used. As far as I cantell there are four ways in which one could technically answer query 1:   1. Look at the website: https://atlas.ripe.net/anchors/list/      -> 840 results   2. Query the /anchors API with attribute is_disabled = false:      https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/anchors/?is_disabled=false      -> 844 results   3. Query the /probes API with attributes is_anchor = true and status = 1      (Connected):      https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/probes/?is_anchor=True&status=1      -> 729 results   4. Query the /probes API with attributes tags = system-anchor and status = 1      (Connected):      https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/probes/?tags=system-anchor&status=1      -> 729 resultsMethods 3 and 4 are actually consistent!The main discrepancy is between the /anchors and /probes API: 116 anchors thatare listed on the webpage and/or /anchors API as ‘active’ are inactive (97abandoned; 19 disconnected at time of writing) according to their respective/probes entry.I understand that disconnects might be temporary, but some anchors seem to beinactive for years (at least according to their status) and are still listed asactive.I have attached a text file with some notes that go deeper into the differences,but might be hard to read.For query 2, I faced a similar situation:   1. Look at the website: https://atlas.ripe.net/anchors/list/full/       Anchoring Mesh IPv4:  840       Anchoring Mesh IPv6:  739     Anchoring Probes IPv4:  840     Anchoring Probes IPv6:  705                     Total: 3124   2. Query the /anchor-measurements API       Anchoring Mesh IPv4:  849       Anchoring Mesh IPv6:  743     Anchoring Probes IPv4:  902     Anchoring Probes IPv6:  753                     Total: 3247   3. Query the /measurements API with attributes status = 2 (Ongoing),      type = traceroute and corresponding attributes:      Anchoring Mesh IPv4: af = 4; tags=anchoring,mesh      Anchoring Mesh IPv6: af = 6; tags=anchoring,mesh      Anchoring Probes IPv4: af = 4; tags=anchoring,probes      Anchoring Probes IPv6: af = 6; tags=anchoring,probes      For example:        https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/?status=2&type=traceroute&af=6&tags=anchoring,probes       Anchoring Mesh IPv4: 1026       Anchoring Mesh IPv6:  902     Anchoring Probes IPv4:  668     Anchoring Probes IPv6:  619                     Total: 3215These results are even more mixed:   - Tags can be inconsistent: Some measurements have none, some have the     ‘probes’ or ’mesh’ tag, but miss the ’anchoring’ tag.   - Some anchors have multiple measurements (especially probes measurements), of     which most actually are run by the same set of probes, i.e., they are     duplicates.   - Which measurements are contained in which of the three result sets is very     mixed, maybe I should draw a Venn diagram :)Finally, I looked at the consistency of the IP addresses of the /anchors API(ip_v4 and ip_v6), the /probes API (address_v4, address_v6), the DNS result forthe FQDN of the anchors, and the target IP of the mesh/probes measurements.I noticed some problems, since our lab (IIJ) also operates an anchor (probe 6425[0]) and we updated the IP address some time ago, but are actually not reachedby the mesh measurement, because the measurement still targets the old IP.I attached a CSV that includes the raw data (of measurements with some form ofproblem), but basically there are 93 measurements from connected anchors thatfail, and out of which 68 (from 29 anchors) could work, if the measurement wouldtarget the correct IP. These measurements have matching anchor/probe IPs and DNSrecords, so I do not know why the measurement target is stale.  There are someadditional measurements that could work, but it is unclear what the intended‘correct’ IP is.On that note, there are 48 measurements that ‘work‘, i.e., they get a responsefrom the target, but it is not clear if the target is the intended receiver:   - 8 target abandoned anchors   - 18 have different probe and anchor IPs and target one of them   - 21 have the same probe and anchor IP but target something elseAgain, I am sorry for this long mail. I understand that RIPE Atlas is a hugeproject that has grown over time so it might be hard to keep some thingssynchronized, and some other things might not be easily decidable (e.g., when tomark an anchor is inactive).However, I think especially the IP address of an anchor in the /anchors and/probes APIs, in the DNS entry, and the target of the mesh/probes measurementsneed to be consistent. Currently some mesh measurements might target an entirelydifferent machine.I wanted to bring some attention to this, but not sure what else I can do as auser.

In  the (near) future the web content will be all based off the data from  the API. We are aware of inconsistencies between the web content and the  API but these will most likely not be fixed until we switch the pages  over to using the API instead.  > >   1.

Active and Inactive are anchor data points while connected/abandoned are  probe data points.  This means in short that anchors can be active while the probe is  considered abandoned. We are rethinking the whole connected/disconnected and abandoned  terminology but for now these will be different concepts.  > > I understand that disconnects might be temporary, but some anchors  > seem to be > inactive for years (at least according to their status) and are still  > listed as > active. It does make sense to mark an anchor as inactive when the probe becomes  abandoned so I will implement that soon. This will make the results a  little more predictable and logical. > > I have attached a text file with some notes that go deeper into the  > differences, > but might be hard to read. > > > For query 2, I faced a similar situation: > >   1.

When an anchor changes IP addresses after it's been deployed, the  current set of anchoring measurements needs to be stopped and a new set  needs to be created. When checking this, I saw that this hasn't happened  yet for all anchors. I will fix this soon after the RIPE meeting.  This should fix the vast majority of cases where you saw this issue  assuming we are aware of all IP addresses changes.  > > I attached a CSV that includes the raw data (of measurements with some  > form of > problem), but basically there are 93 measurements from connected  > anchors that > fail, and out of which 68 (from 29 anchors) could work, if the  > measurement would > target the correct IP.

The RIPE Atlas sponsorship programme has been established since the beginning of the project back in 2011. We need the support of the RIPE Atlas community to make the project successful and benefit all users, not just our members. This is the reason that we are aiming to shift some of the costs from the membership to the community.    The cost of an active probe is not only the hardware, but also the collection, storage and processing of data measured by the probe - which are operating costs covered by the RIPE NCC.   The figures in the 2021 budget for RIPE Atlas cover the overall cost of running the network. We also budget for a bare minimum of hardware probes to maintain the network and deal with the natural decay of probes over time.  Up until this point, we have not promoted the benefits that potential sponsors receive by sponsoring RIPE Atlas. With the introduction of this new model, we are laying out all the benefits and have added several new incentives to make the packages more attractive.  Regarding your suggestion to source all these costs via next year’s budget, we are happy to hear from members if they want us to do so and take it from there. You can also raise this when we publish our 2022 Activity Plan and Budget ahead of RIPE 83.

The two cases I checked are,1. mega.nz2. t.meIn some cases, It's the Consumer ISP that's blocking access to these domains and in other cases it's the upstream providers like Tata(AS17908) that are blocking access to these sites.To figure out how many probes were effected, I ran 2 TLS tests. The results of those tests are here,1. https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/32358061/2. https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/32358052/As you'll see that almost every probe received correct TLS Certificate with mega.nz and excluding 4-5 probes, All the other probes received correct certificates for t.me. These measurements include 2 probes that I run in AS9829 and AS45609. Somehow, Both of my probes reported that they received the correct/valid certificate in both of these measurement when it doesn't appear to be true.I am presented with connection closed error when accessing these sites over HTTP and a connection reset error when accessing these sites over HTTPS over both WANs used by the two probes.Have I misunderstood TLS tests? I am not sure what is happening here and I really appreciate any insight I can get on these results. I have also included the relevant section from the logs of 1 of my probes.atlas_run: looking for 'evsslgetcert -4 -p 443 -h mega.nz -A ""32358061"" 66.203.127.18'eooqd: found cmd 'evsslgetcert' for 'evsslgetcert -4 -p 443 -h mega.nz -A ""32358061"" 66.203.127.18'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[0] = 'evsslgetcert'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[1] = '-4'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[2] = '-p'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[3] = '443'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[4] = '-h'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[5] = 'mega.nz'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[6] = '-A'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[7] = '32358061'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[8] = '66.203.127.18'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[9] = '-O'eooqd: atlas_run: argv[10] = '/var/atlas-probe/data/new/ooq.2'eooqd: init returned 0x738200 for 'evsslgetcert -4 -p 443 -h mega.nz -A ""32358061"" 66.203.127.18'eooqd: check_resolv_conf2: no change (time 1632496526)msgbuf_read: buf_read failedooqd: command is done for cmdstate 0x738200sslgetcert_delete: state 0x738200, index 0, busy 0total size in dir: 5982httppost: before getaddrinfohttppost: before connecthttppost: sending requestposting file '/var/atlas-probe/data/out/ooq/2'httppost: getting resulthttppost: getting reply headershttppost: got line 'Server: nginx'httppost: got line 'Date: Fri, 24 Sep 2021 15:56:32 GMT'httppost: got line 'Content-Type: text/plain'httppost: got line 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked'httppost: got line 'Connection: close'httppost: writing outputhttppost: chunked 1, content_length -1httppost: got chunk line '3'httppost: chunk data 'OKRegardsIshan Jain"	"{0: {'username': 'Cameron Steel', 'date_epoch': 1632565380.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-09-25 03:23:00', 'response_content': 'Hi Ishan, In those two measurements, it certainly seems that most probes are connecting to Mega/Telegram and obtaining the correct TLS certificates.  To verify this on your machine, use openssl and ensure the SHA1 fingerprints match those reported in the Atlas measurements:  $ echo ""Q"" | openssl s_client -connect mega.nz:443 -servername mega.nz | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1  $ echo ""Q"" | openssl s_client -connect t.me:443 -servername t.me | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1   If you don’t get matching fingerprints there, have a look whether the IP addresses returned by DNS are correct:  $ host mega.nz  $ host t.me   If that’s all fine, then you should also be able to load the addresses with curl:  $ curl -i https://mega.nz  $ curl -i https://t.me  For mega, the expected response is 200 OK, and for t.me, a 302 redirect to telegram.org   Let us know how far you get. There’s many ways to prevent access to a site: blocking or modifying DNS, not routing traffic to certain IPs, intercepting HTTP, etc. It’s possible that whatever method is used here would block say, web browser access but not a probe TLS connection, though that would be a little odd.  Another thing to note is that both mega and telegram publish IPv6 records for those hostnames. The measurements you ran that showed a working connection were set to IPv4-only. It may be the case that IPv4 access is not blocked, however IPv6 access is.

A quick query:  https://gist.github.com/sdstrowes/e9d4a3c7c03dd1aafa3198333cc39ffa  Out of ~106M IPv4 traceroutes, this finds ~6M that contain 10.0.0.0/8 in  an ICMP response more than 4 hops from the origin. That\'s not the  smartest approach, but it\'s a good ballpark of what\'s in the data.  It\'d be reasonably easy to take that and whittle it down to a set of  probes and/or probe ASNs that see this. With more work it\'d be possible  to identify ASNs on the forward path as a strong hint (asymmetric  routing to one side) of where these pass through.

Thinking about this... Is there any reason except formalities why you shouldn't forward those packets?  The won't generate a reply and can't generate an ICMP error, so their source address will never be used as a destination.  Agreed, it would be better if they had a global source. But they don't.  Maybe because there was none configured on the router/host the error message originates from?  In any case, the source address is what it is and you can either forward the packet or drop it. Dropping it means the information is lost.  Maybe breaking PMTU or whatever.  I believe it's better to ignore the formalities here and forward those packets.  It's certainly harmless.  At least as harmless as forwarding any other ICMP error messages.

If you can't verify the source, which with LL you cannot as they are on every interface around the world, it is spoofable.  Do you really want to receive a fe80::/10 at your recursive DNS service as a request (which could be valid, locally).  fe80::/10 should never have a TTL other than 1... it is link-local.   The whole point of the thread is to find networks that allow non-routed addresses, the standard BCP38 trick.

With more work it'd be possible to identify ASNs on the forward path as a strong hint (asymmetric routing to one side) of where these pass through.   Good one. Indeed, if one can go through the existing traceroute data, one would have the possibility to detect these.  Any way we could automate this into a nice warning page along with the probability that an ASN is the cause of passing on RFC1918 (and thus likely not filtering at all)?

If you allow fe80::/10 at your recursive DNS service then you will make sure this prefix cannot be spoofed.  This is a policy for the next-hop router seen from the DNS server (if there is any - I\'m not sure why I\'d allow fe80::/10 on any link with a router).  But the point is that this policy does not need to affect any other router on the Internet. And I would most certainly not depend on the configuration of other routers outside my control for anything security related.  Not that different from the RPF you will do in your own network to protect agaist spoofing the other prefixes allowed at your recursive DNS service.  It\'s nice if people do RPF elsewhere too, but not something I\'d depend on for my DNS service.  I still do not see any problems letting the DNS server receive ""illegal"" ICMP errors though.  > fe80::/10 should never have a TTL other than 1... it is link-local.  Maybe so.  But that\'s not enforced anywhere.  Many common IP applications can use LL addresses with the appropriate zone identifier, but will not change the header to adapt to any LL restrictions.  And the same goes for applications implemented in the kernel. if you ping ff02::1 on a link with some hosts, then you\'ll probably see a number of replies from LL sources with ttl=64.  > The whole point of the thread is to find networks that allow > non-routed addresses, the standard BCP38 trick. Detecting RFC1918 in > traceroutes might just be a cheap-ish way to identify these kind of > networks (especially when outbound NAT happens, thus spoofing gets > killed).  Yes, I see the value in that test and it does sound like a reasonable approach.  It was just the notion that there should be any problem forwarding ICMP errors with ""illegal"" source addresses that caught my attention.  I don\'t think there is, regardless of the reason the address is defined as illegal.

Let\'s hope someone else cares enough to do that :-)  An additional argument for allowing the ICMP errors, and only those, is that you can\'t send back any dest unreachable with ""Beyond scope of source address"".

A traceroute with a spoofed address indeed would not return anything, as you are not the source.  This is about doing a traceroute, from whatever your host/probe is configured for, and thus also means that a NAT would change that source address.   For instance a result (towards the above IP) could look like;  ... 11  Bundle-Ether41.br03.mrs01.pccwbtn.net (63.223.38.74)  31.672 ms  31.720 ms Bundle-Ether42.br03.mrs01.pccwbtn.net (63.223.38.78)  29.302 ms 12  Bundle-Ether41.br03.mrs01.pccwbtn.net (63.223.38.74)  31.549 ms  31.094 ms  31.863 ms 13  63.222.97.82 (63.222.97.82)  76.494 ms 10.74.42.53 (10.74.42.53)  81.986 ms 63.222.97.90 (63.222.97.90)  77.033 ms 14  * * * 15  * * 10.74.19.109 (10.74.19.109)  87.029 ms 16  * * *  which shows that hop 15 was able to respond with RFC1918, all the hops upto that point are thus not bothering to check if the source was allowed to send; I can tell you RFC1918 should never be visible there...  Yes, the ISP that allowed this traceroute is very aware of this problem, at least they filter prefixes at the edge, thus hosts cannot spoof, but their transit/peering links they can spoof what they want. Which leads to them having big issues when a spoofed DNS amp DDoS comes in as they have little clue where it comes from, thus they understand they need to fix this..... but likely many places, while one can convert this to a dollar amount lost (when a DDoS happens), there are other more urgent things for them.   > Because IF your packets were forwarded with spoofed source, you won't got any response, not even from the first hop.  Correct, but this is more about recognizing where filtering does not happen, as that indicates that other paths over that route can also spoof if their edges do not filter at source.  > Obviously, because your false source IP would get the ICMP returns, not your probe. >  > So, IMHO, it's more likely to me your traceroute is proof for a NAT and not for spoofing.

To be difficult again.... But I don't think you can make that assumption unless you are able to detect that the ICMP errors cross some network border.  Using RFC1918 on links in your own network is fine. And having them show up in traceroutes is a feature.  To illustrate, this a traceroute from a standard mobile netowrk access to one of the DNS resolvers used from that access:  bjorn@miraculix:~$ traceroute -e 130.67.15.198 traceroute to 130.67.15.198 (130.67.15.198), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets  1  77.16.1.8.tmi.telenormobil.no (77.16.1.8)  435.127 ms  644.941 ms  644.890 ms  2  ti0006c360-ae17-0.ti.telenor.net (146.172.18.85)   653.783 ms  653.735 ms  653.686 ms  3  ti0300c360-ae4-0.ti.telenor.net (146.172.23.174)   653.638 ms  653.592 ms  653.543 ms  4  10.67.115.189 (10.67.115.189)  653.481 ms  653.432 ms  653.383 ms  5  * * *  6  ti0001a401-ae18-21.ti.telenor.net (213.142.76.153)  653.270 ms  206.020 ms  32.959 ms  7  ti0275c360-ae49-0.ti.telenor.net (146.172.22.98)   33.781 ms  32.122 ms  35.930 ms  8  ti0275a400-ae1-0.ti.telenor.net (146.172.101.94)  37.812 ms  40.701 ms  40.666 ms  9  ns11.e.nsc.no (130.67.15.198)  40.628 ms  40.591 ms  40.555 ms   So you can see the RFC1918 address on one of the links between the VPN with the PGW and the Internet.

My example didn\'t make that clear, but the traceroute probes are sent from an RFC1918 address:   bjorn@miraculix:~$ ip route get 130.67.15.198  130.67.15.198 dev wwan0 src 10.82.241.88 uid 1000       cache   So you should drop packets using RFC1918 addresses on that link?   > Given the age of the document, the language used to be less STRONG > back then.

It doesn\'t.  It is very clear that *if* you do, it\'s your responsibility to ensure ICMP packets are not sent from a RFC1918 address.  This is not a fault in the RFC, it\'s a fault in the way these people build their networks.  > My example didn\'t make that clear, but the traceroute probes are sent > from an RFC1918 address: >  >  bjorn@miraculix:~$ ip route get 130.67.15.198 >  130.67.15.198 dev wwan0 src 10.82.241.88 uid 1000  >      cache  >  > So you should drop packets using RFC1918 addresses on that link?

Exactly my point.  My traceroute example is all in ""my"" network if you include the mobile access endpoint.  The usage of RFC1918 for PGW pools and links is co-ordinated.  There is no reason you should not see RFC1918 adresses as source here.  >> > Given the age of the document, the language used to be less STRONG >> > back then. >>  >> Sure.

In the example I gave it is all quite obvious actually... as there are multiple ASNs in the path and then RFC1918...

There is an option in the measurement specification called 'Resolve on  Probe'.

59	[atlas] Upgrade existing Anchor to newer hardware	Cathal Mooney	1628200224.0	2021-08-05 14:50:24	Hi,I am working for the Wikimedia Foundation, and we have several AtlasAnchor's deployed at various locations.Some time ago the Anchor we had in our location in Dallas, US(p6093.probes.atlas.ripe.net) failed due to a hardware failure.  Weare now attempting to replace the Anchor with new hardware which wehave installed.The old device was a v2 Anchor (Soekris), however, and the new deviceis v3 (PC Engines APU.2E2).  Given the newer hardware I expect we willneed a different USB image to boot from?  Our hope would be to re-usethe previous IP addressing and other details so that does not need tochange.What might be the best way to approach this?Many thanks,Cathal.

My problem now is that my probe General Information is reporting ""Resolves AAAACorrectly, Doesn't Resolve A, IPv4 Stable 1d, IPv4 Works, Software IPv4RFC1918, IPv4 Capable"" but I can't seem to fix the ""Doesn't Resolve A"" problem:is there anything specific that I can try from the command line to diagnosethis?FWIW, all other traceroutes, pings, digs etc on the box seem to be working."	{}

I assume you talk about a hardware probe (the behavior on software  probes is out of control of ripe).  Recognizing the new network takes a while. But in the end, I think it is a flaw of your router. It should withdraw  the old prefix by using reasonable life times/ zero life times.  Here is an example with a hw probe and ~daily reconnects. The measured  disconnected time is between 2 and 5 minutes usually. I think that's ok.   https://atlas.ripe.net/probes/53236/#tab-network   Regards, Thomas""}, 2: {'username': 'Nick Hilliard', 'date_epoch': 1624299729.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-06-21 11:22:09', 'response_content': ""Marco Davids (IETF) via ripe-atlas wrote on 21/06/2021 07:20: > Is this a flaw, or is it by design?  this is a known protocol issue with slaac.

There's some discussion about it in rfc8978 and draft-ietf-6man-slaac-renum.  To be correct; it's an operational issue. SLAAC works as designed with IPv6 renumbering. Imagine if the mobile operator swapped your mobile phone number midstream.  Support for ephemeral addressing (aka flash renumbering) is quite involved. The mobile phone stacks have largely managed to do that, but for all else it involves transitioning away from TCP, updating all apps etc...

SLAAC works as designed with IPv6 renumbering.  slaac - being stateless 'n all - was not designed with flash renumbering  in mind because flash renumbering needs some degree of state  synchronisation on all devices on the path between the provisioning  system issuing the prefix and the end device. So in this sense it is a  protocol issue, albeit an issue that was outside the design scope of the  protocol.  > Imagine if the mobile operator swapped your mobile phone number midstream.  mobile phone numbers are stateful.

Not sure why, but recently this seems to occur more than  before. Previously my prefix seemed to have a bigger change of surviving  such a reboot.

The absolute minimum set is DHCP, DNS and outgoing TCP port 443 (HTTPS)  in order to allow the probe to connect to the network. However, this in  itself is not enough to do measurements, which is the entire focus of  RIPE Atlas. The more kinds of outgoing traffic you allow, the more  measurements will have a chance of succeeding. So please, at a minimum,  also permit outgoing ICMP, UDP (DNS + traceroute + NTP) and TCP for  traceroute and HTTP(S). Permitting outgoing DNS to any server is a must  in order to be useful for non-local-resolver queries.  For incoming traffic: the probes don't provide real accessible services,  so incoming ICMP/ping and UDP/traceroute should be enough.    I hope this helps, Robert""}}"

When it happened to one of my probes earlier this year, I moved the  USB-stick to a Linux computer and ran a ""badblocks -svw"" on the stick.

This bug affected many users who submitted ""removal"" requests using the REST API from 2021-03-23, and in some cases caused a large increase in the consumption of credits due to the extra generated measurement results.This bug has now been fixed, and the affected accounts have been credited with approximately 125% of the erroneous overpayment.My apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Knowing that I have already used it to create measurements and get measurement results and in other apis from Ripe.Concerning the example below, I have checked the measurement ID and that the probe in the source ID figures among the participant probes. I don't quiet see the source of the problem, do you have any ideas about this?Thank you,Cheers,Sanaa 	{}

We encourage hosts to tag their probes with whatever they find useful to  share. I consider the connection type as one such useful attribute. Not  everyone does this but indeed as Grzegorz says:  > https://atlas.ripe.net//api/v2/probes/?tags=Satellite  > https://atlas.ripe.net//api/v2/probes/?tags=VSAT   This is what hosts already did. The list is likely not complete, and may  contain false positives.  > Funny thing is that \'VSAT\' is not visible in  > https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/probes/tags/   I can explain this: all user-assigned tags start their lives on one  probe. Some tags are not likely to be ever used by multiple hosts (eg.  ""email_[address]_for_questions""), others become popular and are used on  multiple probes. We periodically ""approve"" the ones that look like they  are common, so they publicly pop up in various places, eg. the one you  point to above. I just approved the VSAT tag.  > This gives you the list of probes that have a last-mile median RTT (endpoint_type=LM&median__gte=495) higher than 495ms: > https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/api/network_delay/?timebin=2021-04-21T00%3A15&endpoint_type=LM&median__gte=495  I suspect Stephen will soon offer a self-service alternative using  BigQuery any minute now :-)  Cheers, Robert'}, 5: {'username': 'Ray Bellis', 'date_epoch': 1619199859.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-04-23 10:44:19', 'response_content': 'On 22/04/2021 20:52, Ponikierski, Grzegorz via ripe-atlas wrote: > Checking > first hop can be tricky because this first hop can be local router with > RTT <1ms and second hop can indicate that we are on satellite > connectivity.

Here are some probes that I spotted on my own Atlas visualiser as having slow access to the DNS root system (~300ms+) followed up by queries to measurements to #1 or #2 to look for very slow last ""mile"" connectivity:  11268 (DSL, very variable 100 - 900ms) 12803 (4G, /me waves at Eberhard!) 16494 (LTE, variable 30 - 250ms) 20306 (Satellite, 1st and 2nd sub 3ms, root servers 700ms+) 26228 (data not accessible) 27843 (data not accessible) 33110 (untagged, 2nd hop 270 - 420ms) 50592 (""Swisscom SAT Probe"", 1st and 2nd hop sub 4ms, root 600ms+) 51871 (FTTH, 1st and 2nd hops sub 2ms, large root latency jump today) 52560 (""FastestVPN"", consistent 285ms second hop) 1000244 (untagged, 2nd hop 600ms, occasional drops to 60ms) 1000795 (untagged, very variable, 35 - 1000ms!)  For background, the RSSAC Local Perspective WG is looking at measurements of the root system, perhaps using Atlas, but we\'d like to be able to establish a baseline figure that we can subtract to account for probes that are on the end of a slow internet access technology.  We don\'t want the figures skewed by these outliers.  I\'ll probably need to do some explicit traceroutes on those where the high latency was not introduced by the 1st or 2nd hop to find out where the latency does happen.  I also spotted an odd probe geolocated in the north SF Bay area but with 170ms second hop latency and only hitting root anycast instances located in Europe.  It smells like a long distance BGP tunnel to me, but I know the individual that runs that network so I\'ll check with him.

These earth stations are known to be located at either the Starlink offices in Redmond, WA, there is one site colocated with a Level3/Centurylink/Lumen DWDM site slightly east of Seattle, and another which is at a commercial teleport in the north-central part of the state.  RTT ICMP ping times to things in Seattle are a combination of two round trips through space, plus modem framing/encoding/FEC, and terrestrial latency from one of those earth stations to the downtown Seattle destination and back. For instance to the anycase instances of a nameserver that I know to be physically located at one of Seattle\'s main carrier hotels.

80	[atlas] RIPE Atlas CLI tools docker image	Anurag Bhatia	1619462589.0	2021-04-26 11:43:09	Hello everyone,A little while ago I put RIPE Atlas CLI tools docker image based onalpine.  - https://hub.docker.com/r/anuragbhatia/ripe-atlas-toolsIt stores the API keys at ~/.config on the host (and that is mounted insidethe container). Dockerfile can be found hereand one can use it to build image locally if intended to.*Example usage: *docker run --rm -v ~/.config:/root/.config -itanuragbhatia/ripe-atlas-tools ripe-atlas measure traceroute --from-countryIN --target he.netOne can set an alias in the local shell to make it appear almost like alocally installed setup.E.g on fish:anurag@Anurags-MacBook-Pro ~> alias ripe-atlas='docker run --rm -v~/.config:/root/.config -it anuragbhatia/ripe-atlas-tools ripe-atlas'anurag@Anurags-MacBook-Pro ~> funcsave ripe-atlasanurag@Anurags-MacBook-Pro ~>Thus the reduces syntax is alias becomes:ripe-atlas measure traceroute --from-country IN --target he.netPlease do share if anyone has any feedback.-- Anurag Bhatiaanuragbhatia.com	{}

This kind of query can be where the public bigquery datasets are useful,  because bigquery will let you walk through the result data directly.  (Some details and pre-requisites are at [1,2]).

You cannot filter directly on the probes but you can include the list of  probes participating in the measurement:  https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/29786041/?optional_fields=probes    You can then iterate over this key to find if the probes you're looking  for are included and get only those results with something like this:  https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/29786041/results/?probe_ids=6945    Hope this helps,  Cheers, Johan  > > > Thank you > > -- > Sanaa > >""}}"

83	[atlas] Request for credits for research	Nitinder Mohan	1600930933.0	2020-09-24 00:02:13	"Dear RIPE community,I hope you are all safe and sound.I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. We are currently working on an ongoing research project which aims to analyze the availability and reachability of cloud data centers globally. The first work of our work will appear in ACM HotNets 2020 titled ""Pruning Edge Research with Latency Shears"" (http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2020/program.html). We are currently preparing the camera-ready version of the paper and will share it with the community by hosting it (and the associated dataset) publicly soon.We are currently planing to submit the second leg of our work to a conference with submission deadline a month.

This email is a follow-up to our request for Atlas credits back in September 2020. Following our request, we received an overwhelming response from the community to assist our research by transferring us credits and giving us best wishes for project completion. Today, I am elated to let you all know that we have successfully concluded our project and I would be happy to share the results with all of you.  Our project focused on analyzing the availability and reachability of cloud datacenters across the globe. The motivation for our work stemmed from the lack of any recently conducted global cloud measurement study which can be used for assessing the growth of cloud networks in the past decade. We feel that such an impartial study is not only useful for researchers working in domains such as edge computing, 5G/6G, cloud computing etc. but can also be valuable for folks from industry and for the general public.  Back in 2019 we launched our cloud reachability study, targeting 10 major cloud operators (189 compute cloud regions) across the globe. We collected ICMP and TCP pings along with Traceroutes periodically over the Atlas platform. The results from this project has been successfully published in top-tier venues such as ACM HotNets 2020, The Web Conference (WWW) 2021 and IFIP Networking 2021. We release all collected dataset and associated code for public and community use. You can browse/play with our results learn more about the project objectives and download our datasets from here: https://cloudreachability.github.io/  I would like to thank the RIPE community for being so supportive to our (and generally to) research endeavours. If you have any questions regarding our work, I will be very happy to answer them.

We are currently working on an ongoing research project which aims to analyze the availability and reachability of cloud data centers globally. The first work of our work will appear in ACM HotNets 2020 titled ""Pruning Edge Research with Latency Shears"" (http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2020/program.html). We are currently preparing the camera-ready version of the paper and will share it with the community by hosting it (and the associated dataset) publicly soon.     We are currently planing to submit the second leg of our work to a conference with submission deadline a month. In order to complete all set of measurements for required analysis, we are scheduling very large-scale measurements over the platform which has burned through almost all our credits and left us in need. I have always found the RIPE Atlas community to be helpful and generous towards research and I am hoping that you could support our research by donating us some of your spare credits. Your help will be highly appreciated.

To Philip\'s point, the basic protocol I am hoping to enable looks as follows: (I\'ll describe the roughtime variant) * A machine wants to attest that it is in (e.g. Seattle). It picks a set of machines that are believed to be in Seattle (perhaps atlas machines, or more generally machines that the measurement system has agreed on locations of in advance.) * It generates a statement saying ""i am doing a measurement"", and signs it. * It requests the time with it\'s own signature as a nonce and receives a (timestamp, uncertainty, signature) from the server, per https://blog.cloudflare.com/roughtime/ * It then immediately req-requests the time, using the signature it received as the nonce this time, and receives a second timestamp, uncertainty, signature.  The combination of this data can then be provided to any other machine to place a bound on the RTT between the machine and the chosen measurement machine (the difference between the two timestamps). This can be validated without trusting the machine claiming it\'s latency bound, since the results are signed by the anchor.  There are some complexities - e.g could the machine attesting it\'s location delegate the request to a different machine closer to the anchor? Depending on the situation there are mitigations for this, like asking that some piece of data the machine that\'s attesting it\'s location be hashed into the nonce, in a way that\'s difficult for the attesting machine to predict ahead of time (so that it would need to move all of its data to the delegate machine at which point it\'s already in a sense also in that secondary location at that time.) But the ability to locate client software deployment via latency with some guarantee that someone running it isn\'t spoofing their location is useful.  An equivalent to this protocol can be used against tls1.2 servers that include the timestamp in their server randomness, with the caveat that those timestamps are only at second granularity. To compensate, the client will repeat the hashing RTT process for 1 second, so that the validatable data that is presented shows that the client was able to do \'n\' RTT\'s with the server within one second.  --Will  On Wed, Apr 7, 2021 at 4:12 AM Rick Havern <richard.havern _at_ geant _dot_ org> wrote:  > Couldn\'t this functionality be extended to the Atlas Anchors? > > Rick > > -----Original Message----- > From: ripe-atlas <ripe-atlas-bounces _at_ ripe _dot_ net> On Behalf Of Philip Homburg > Sent: 07 April 2021 10:27 > To: ripe-atlas _at_ ripe _dot_ net > Subject: Re: [atlas] Feature request for Validated Timestamps > > On 2021/04/06 17:04 , Will wrote: > > I\'m not sure if there\'s a process for this sort of feature request > > beyond this mailing list.

It seems to me that this can be simplified a bit, the first step can be  just a nonce. Basically: - The client generates a random nonce - The client uses to nonce to obtain the time from a server using the  nonce and the roughtime protocol - The client generates a new nonce from the reply by hashing the reply - The client uses the second nonce to once again obtain the time. - The client packs the two nonces and the two replies and reports it as  measurement result.  Later, a verifier can check the signatures in the two replies to verify  that responses came from the right server. Then a check is made that the  second nonce is derived from the first reply. Finally a check is made  that the replies correspond to the nonces. Note that the first nonce  serves no value, so could be omitted from the measurement result and  verification.  Open issue: key management. How to store all public keys of all servers  for ever.  This seems fine, however...  > There are some complexities - e.g could the machine attesting it\'s  > location delegate the request to a different machine closer to the  > anchor?

If we assume that the client is malicous, what prevents the client from  using a collaborating machine to execute the protocol, proving the  location of the collaborating machine. The client just submits the  results as its own?

We don\'t have strict rules about precisely how the hosts should  geolocate their probes -- and could not enforce those even if we had  them. Instead we recommend doing this ""roughly correct"", which for some  hosts means city / neighbourhood is good enough, for some others it\'s  the exact spot of the utility box at home :-)  > Can anyone confirm the geo-location obfuscation of probes as being up to  > 1km as per  > https://atlas.ripe.net/about/faq/#are-the-locations-of-probes-made-public  >  > I am a Phd student carrying out research on the RIPE atlas platform and  > an early result seems to indicate 1 probe has an obfuscation of 10km  > distance but this may be an anomaly or perhaps something not taken into  > account as yet.  We have a very simple algorithm that does the obfuscation consistently  with a certain maximum distance added, which may not be precisely 1km.  We can talk offline about the details if you\'re really interested in the  precise method.

I suspect you’d find the latency method below to be pretty inaccurate as well.  If latency from a known-location probe were low, that would tell you something definitive, but if it were high it might just be telling you that the local ISPs in a region don’t talk to each other locally.  Maxmind et al. have hopefully already done a bunch of that work.  -Steve Global Traceroute  > On Mar 25, 2021, at 6:02 AM, Massimo Candela <massimo _at_ us.ntt _dot_ net> wrote: >  > [possibly OT] >  > In 2018 we found 18 probes which were located so far from reality that the collected RTT towards targets of known locations was faster than the speed of light (I remember we did something about those).

We don\'t have strict rules about precisely how the hosts should geolocate their probes -- and could not enforce those even if we had them.

It\'s a good point - I\'m sorry that I made an assumption that there is awareness about this RIPE NCC activity:  we have been discussing the ""Internet in Country X"" for multiple years now, but it used to be called ""Member Lunch"" when we could travel. During 2020, this turned into ""Open House"" format -- and we\'ve had many in 2020; the 2021 started with ""Internet in Iceland"" , Turkey was next, and there are several more already scheduled; you can see the list here:  https://www.ripe.net/participate/meetings/open-house  I hope this clarifies that there is no specific ""issue"", it\'s a way to both support local communities, and collect feedback - in a forum smaller than RIPE Meeting, or even Regional Meting.

Those that have beein doing IPv6 since ages would claim that any time spent on ""making formerly-reserved IPv4 addresses usable world-wide"" is energy lost on making IPv4 go away instead... so, ""no"".  Those that want to avoid deploying IPv6 will, of course, support anything, no matter how expensive, which gives them the illusion that this is a viable strategy :-)  I think my response might be a bit biased.

I support this notion, too - Avoinding the part about if it\'s stupid or ""brilliant"" to expand the public v4 space - Focusing on the RIPE Atlas part.  Knowing the current extent to which e.g. 240/4 is deployed in the wild from a measurement perspective I find an interesting object to read ""research results"" on.  Putting this in as a future [feature request] for the software development of the RIPE Atlas probe software (for the developer team to evaluate) I do not see an issue with it at all.

Personally, from perspective of company with global dual-stack platform, I would like to spend my time and energy on IPv6, automation, RPKIs, prefix leaks, providers relationships and prefix propagation rather than on figuring out how to prolong IPv4 life. Enabling 0/8 and 240/4 sounds simple but it requires global coordination to make it work and we already have community fully occupied with other activities. I think that decision about enabling 240/4 should be made 15-20 years ago and now it\'s too late to make the effort worth it (it will take years to implement). Still I can imagine that we have anti IPv-6 providers desperate enough to use 240/4 instead of paying for prefixes on the second hand market of IPv4. For these folks RIPE Atlas with enabled 0/8 and 240/4 would be a useful feature to troubleshoot problems which they will for sure face as early adopters.

Recently, I\'ve been working with John Gilmore on the IPv4 Unicast Extensions Project, which aims to make some of the IPv4 address blocks that were reserved in the 1980s and 1990s (and that continue to be unused, or nearly so) available for addressing and routing on the Internet.  This project involves many different kinds of work, including writing software patches to make various OSes and devices willing to generate and accept packets to reserved addresses, writing Internet-Drafts to describe addressing policy changes with IETF, testing devices to see how they actually treat such packets, talking to various constituencies about these proposals, and working with the Internet measurement community to understand how the Internet as a whole treats packets to or from currently-reserved address ranges, and how that treatment evolves over time.  Two prominent examples that are already supported by Linux hosts are the netblocks 0/8 (""this network"") and 240/4 (""experimental""/""future use""). According to Internet standards created in the 1980s and still in effect, these address ranges cannot be allocated and should not be assigned to hosts or used on the public Internet.  However, several key implementations started allowing 240/4 addresses about 11 years ago during an earlier IETF attempt to open up that netblock, including Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, and Solaris.  In 2019, Linux kernel version 5.3 allowed ordinary unicast use of 0/8.  Today, there are rumors that various organizations are currently using such reserved addresses as unofficial RFC 1918-like private address space, without formal policy coordination with anyone.

So, I\'m here to introduce our project and ask the community\'s view about removing these restrictions so that such addresses can actually be probed and measured.  We understand and hope that the majority of such tests would currently result in errors.  Even the errors themselves could be interesting: for example, we would like to know how often routing to reserved address ranges fails on a probe host, versus on the probe host\'s first-hop router, versus inside of ISP infrastructure.

We would also like to see whether we can detect unofficial use of particular reserved address ranges as private address space.  Our medium-term goal is to advertise global routes to portions of these reserved address spaces, and use the probes to assess how well those routes propagate through the Internet, and find where blockages occur.  Clearly, we can\'t do this until both the probe firmware, and the central dispatcher, allow tests to these addresses.

Model: TL-MR3020(UN) Ver: 1.9 ; S/N: 2176197008302. When I realised it this atlas probe was not ping-able. ( due to a power outage )I followed the instructions https://labs.ripe.net/Members/philip_homburg/troubleshooting-ripe-atlas-probes-usb-sticks with solution 1.Unfortunately it didn’t work. During the time without USB stick the probe was on the network reachable, getting the IP from DHCP. But later on, it wasn’t ping-able.So I tried solution 2. I took a different USB stick as described. After a while the probe is now ping-able.

Hi Hans,  The probe looks fine now.  We are working on new hardware probes, but there is no clear date yet  when we will have them.

Be aware that the UI  will report the RTT for the last responsive hop in either case, *whether  it's the target or not*. The actual result data reveals a more.   In the case of probe 17832, it doesn't reach the target in either case  above; the low RTT is the last responsive hop very close to the probe.   17875 and 27091 take more reasonable paths over ICMP to the target, but  over TCP appear to receive a response from the target at the second hop.

102	[atlas] Automating software probe creation?	Steve Gibbard	1609601147.0	2021-01-02 08:25:47	I’m working on creating some Raspberry Pi-based software probes, to put in some networks that currently lack Atlas probes.I’d like to have a standard image that can come up and work wherever an individual probe lands, instead of needing to configure each one separately.As far as I can tell from the documentation, it looks like the probes are identified by the encryption keys in /var/atlas-probe/etc/probe-key* .  If creating new probes from an image, is it sufficient to make each probe generate its own encryption keys, or are there other files that need to change?For registering the probes, I see a web form that requires being logged into a RIPE account, and don’t see any equivalent in the API documentation.  Is there a way to register new software probes via the API?Thanks,Steve	"{0: {'username': 'Pierre Barre', 'date_epoch': 1609601948.0, 'date_ymd': '2021-01-02 08:39:08', 'response_content': 'Hi Steve,  About your first question, if my memory serves well, I did it exactly that way a few months back.

That may become too complex. RIPE NCC currently has no API that allows a  user to log in. Logging in goes through a web form.  What we can do (in theory) is support logging in through a web form and  then creating an API key for probe registration (similar to keys we have  for creating measurements).

Thanks for the information, Philip.  I think I now have this in a working state and can attempt a deployment.  If I may turn my question into a feature request:  I believe the API keys you have for measurement creation are already associated with user accounts, so that part seems like a solved problem.  What I have running on my probe hosts so far connects to one of my servers and sends its Atlas public key, ethernet MAC address (so I can track hardware inventory), and some other information to tell me how to remotely manage it.  My server then gets the IP address the probe is connecting from (the probe may not know this itself, if it’s behind a NAT), geolocates it, and puts all the information in a database.  It would be nice if my server could then take that information and go auto-register the probe with Atlas.  As long as the volume is low I can also do this by hand, but being able to automate it would mean the probe could start working when plugged in instead of waiting for me to pay attention to it.

I think this is valuable, you can get an idea of what part of the population is being tampered with either by bad NETGEAR devices or otherwise.  It’s clear you need to design something to measure for this, but I don’t think they should be automatically excluded.  There are providers that do strange things like TTL lengthening which are problematic, but you often can’t see these non-compliant resolvers without a much more in-depth investigation.

I agree with others who said we shouldn\'t *exclude* these. However,  given a workable definition, we can tag these probes which is likely to  be helpful to everyone who are looking for an easy way to filter.  As always, the devil is in the details: if we tag probes ""now"" that does  not mean their behaviour was the same ""yesterday"". So one would need to  align the probe tag times with result times, which complicates things.  > For the visualisation I\'ve just been building based on the Root System\'s > ""hostname.bind"" data returned by Atlas it was pretty difficult to figure > out how to exclude those probes on the client side.  The difficulty is the same (or worse, see below) even if we do this on  the server side :-) So while I don\'t think shifting the solution around  makes things easier, as noted above it can be done ""once"" instead of by  every client.  > If there was a heuristic that could be applied on the probe itself or > within the RIPE data collector that tagged the probe as having ""bad DNS"" > that would help a lot.

(*) The *real* difficulty here is that these rules change over time, and  the decoder needs to follow these changes (if it know about them...)  This fact also makes the server side tagging susceptible to erroneous  tagging.  BTW this very rule set exists in our visualisations already (powering  maps like https://atlas.ripe.net/results/maps/root-instances/). In  reality it\'s 26 entries, not 13, in order to cover historical naming  schemes. Unfortunately so far root server operators haven\'t converged on  a single scheme, and even if they did, the historical queries would not  be simplified.

109	[atlas] RIPE Atlas outage this evening	Robert Kisteleki	1606327141.0	2020-11-25 10:59:01	Dear colleagues,Due to an internal misconfiguration, RIPE Atlas was unavailable between approximately 1:00-9:00 (UTC+1) this morning. This affected the UI, APIs, some internal tasks, and the scheduling of new measurements.Ongoing measurements were not affected.Our team is analysing the root cause and will take steps to prevent this issue from re-occurring.Regards,Robert KistelekiRIPE NCC	{}

These aremeant to make the complete measurement metadata downloadable for thosewho are interested.Even though there is still a point in publishing our metadata in adownloadable format, the current method is not sustainable: as it isdefined it'll grow forever - which is not realistic.Currently *every* dump contains *all* the measurements we *ever* had inthe system. We plan to change that to ""everything that's running now +everything that was running in the last two weeks"". This has about 200kitems currently. If we published this every day instead of once a week,we will still only produce 10% of the output we do today - by virtue ofeliminating 90% of redundancy and repeated work. The syntax andsemantics of the content will not change.We will keep the existing dumps as they are mostly because there's noreason to remove them.What this means for users is:* if you care about ""current / recent"" measurements, you can just usethe last dump from yesterday* if you really need all (or a large part of) history, you can fetch onedump per 2 weeks or so and combine them* you can still use the API for random, finite searchesWe plan to implement the above change just after RIPE 81 (i.e. earlyNovember).

I'm happy to report that the deployment is done - in fact it was  finished around noon or 1pm yesterday. If you go to the RIPE Atlas  website now, you'll see a completely different scaffolding, meaning that  the layout, menus and transitions are entirely new, whereas most of the  page contents are the same they were before.  Even though we tested as much as we could before deployment, we  encountered some problems that we could fix quickly. For example the UI  refused to accept measurements for a short while after the facelift.  (The API worked fine.) Some graphs and maps refused to comply first.  We're still working on minor glitches as we notice them. We appreciate  if you let us know when find something that doesn't look right -  preferably by sending mail to atlas _at_ ripe _dot_ net and not on this list.  Regards, Robert""}}"

You have to parse the results from the start of the measurement and get those executed between the desired time frame by checking its result separately, which is slow (at least I haven't found a better way!)  So having some sort of metadata dumps makes it faster to go through the queries that have been executed in a certain period. I guess another alternative is to download the traces dumps but here the bottleneck is the download time even for a period of 1 day.

It should be possible to get probes installed in a bunch of those, but it would require both available probe hardware and a targeted effort.

My local ISPs have many probes but the small ones don’t. It’s easy enough for me (and probably many others) to help people get more probes on those large ISPs but once there are a number of them with good uptime, it’s not as valuable. What is important is those smaller ISPs.  Perhaps we should try and make some sort of “official” (as in, on behalf of the RIPE Atlas rather than individually) contact with some of these smaller ISPs and see if they can help get probes in their end user networks.

Let me try to address a few points that were mentioned before, perhaps by providing some background information along the way.  The growth rate is indeed slower than in the early days. As with everything, there\'s no single reason for this. On one hand we had shortage of hardware probes (which is hopefully solved for the moment, see: https://labs.ripe.net/Members/alun_davies/new-ripe-atlas-version-4-probes/document_view_resolve). On the other hand, it\'s harder to reach ""uncovered"" networks and as someone mentioned before, the ""the low hanging fruit being pretty saturated"".  We measure ASN coverage compared to all ASN-s that announce anything at all, so depending on how hard one wants to argue for having a probe ""in every AS"", this may or may not need improvement. We\'re certainly encouraging all our ambassadors and prospective hosts to deploy probes where we don\'t have them yet. The current application process has a built-in preference for new networks.  For a few years now the procurement of new probes is funded exclusively by sponsors. Therefore we\'d be very happy to see more sponsors stepping up.  Finally: the public graph about the number of users shows the total we have so far (meaning users who interacted with RIPE Atlas while they were logged in via RIPE Access). We can, if this is deemed useful, track the number of recent users too (for some definition of recent).

124	[atlas] Result processing glitch	Robert Kisteleki	1602543493.0	2020-10-12 15:58:13	Dear RIPE Atlas users,Today one of our controllers (a component that handles probes and deals with their submitted results) was updated to run a new version of result processing code. Unfortunately this code had a bug that caused results to be mixed up. As a result, some of the results that were delivered by this controller were of the wrong type / syntax, which may result in errors in processing this data. We reverted this change as soon as we detected the error.This issue likely affected results delivered by about 2% of our probes, between 13:30 and 15:15 (CEST).We apologise for the inconvenience.Regards,Robert KistelekiRIPE NCC	{}

We are currently working on an ongoing research project which aims to analyze the availability and reachability of cloud data centers globally. The first work of our work will appear in ACM HotNets 2020 titled ""Pruning Edge Research with Latency Shears"" (http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2020/program.html). We are currently preparing the camera-ready version of the paper and will share it with the community by hosting it (and the associated dataset) publicly soon.We are currently planing to submit the second leg of our work to a conference with submission deadline a month. In order to complete all set of measurements for required analysis, we are scheduling very large-scale measurements over the platform which has burned through almost all our credits and left us in need. I have always found the RIPE Atlas community to be helpful and generous towards research and I am hoping that you could support our research by donating us some of your spare credits.

127	[atlas] Invalid results in TraceMON tool	Andreas Siskos	1599682151.0	2020-09-09 13:09:11	Hello everyone,I am an undergraduate student at University of Crete and as a part of mybachelor thesis, I am trying to integrate TraceMONin a website. I used the example code that it was provided by the web pageof TraceMON in RIPE Atlas website (https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/tools-tracemon/#embed), but I noticed somethingunexpected. The graph of the TraceMON was not taking the same path as theraw data of traceroutes. There were the right destinations/IPs, but inshuffled order.Let's consider the example of measurement ID 26813196.As you can see, in the raw data of the traceroute (https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/26813196/results/), it reachesthe target IP (103.83.160.1) at 16th hop from probe 55564.When I checked the graph in TraceMON on the RIPE Atlas website (https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/26813196/#!tracemon) (see attached:general.png), the traceroute from probe 55564 was represented in thepicture graph.png. As you can see in the data file data.png, thedestination IP was reached at 3rd hop instead of 16th, that was in the rawdata of the traceroute. The same behavior can be observed for the probes19648 and 32788.Am I missing something?Thank you in advance,Andreas Siskos	{}
128	[atlas] How can I reduce data usage on remote satellite-connected islands?	Chris Gare	1599677827.0	2020-09-09 11:57:07	Hello all, I've just become an ambassador for the RIPE Atlas programme. I have a question. I wish to deploy a number of probes to remote low-capacity satelliteconnected islands. These islands have strict and VERY expensive monthly usage quotas. Looking at some probes already installed, I see that the minimum bandwidth(is that the term used?) is approximately 3.3kbit/s This equates to around 1GB of data per month which represent a significantpercentage of a consumer's monthly quota. I'll have a hard job convincing volunteers to act as hosts if they consumethat much. Is there a way I can set 'bandwidth' to less than 10kbs or is there aworkaround I can use to reduce this under my control? It has been suggested that I could out a timer on the host but that isnonworkable! Any help would be appreciated as I know that reachability is quiteunreliable at times and the data I could provide would be most interesting. Chris  	{}

However, with all controllers for software probes at Hetzner, a long failure at Hetzner would indeed impact all software probes.In this case, why not have the software probes set up with a fall-backRIPE Atlas Anchor (controller)?E.g.- Setup a list of 2 or more Anchors in a hierarchical order,- If the software probe cannot reach the primary Anchor for more than10-20 minutes., fall-back to the next Anchor reachable,- Retest connectivity to all configured anchors every 6 hours,- Revert to use the first reachable anchor in the locally configuredlist (a hierarchical order).* The above idea assumes an Anchor being able to temp. handle morethan the default ~500 probes per Anchor, plus co-location diversity of>= 2 providers and >= 3 anchors.--Chriztoffer	"{0: {'username': 'Robert Kisteleki', 'date_epoch': 1597084292.0, 'date_ymd': '2020-08-10 11:31:32', 'response_content': ""Hello,  > In this case, why not have the software probes set up with a fall-back > RIPE Atlas Anchor (controller)?  It's worth mentioning that a probe not being able to connect to its assigned controller is the exceptional status, not the general rule.  Probes quite happily continue to measure and store results for later delivery even if they are disconnected from the infrastructure. Obviously they cannot receive new measurement requests while they are disconnected. The complexity of handling the exceptional case is a high price to pay considering that  1) the controlling infrastructure is partially hosted at the RIPE NCC, partially at hosting providers, with enough 9s of uptime, and  2) disconnects are basically always partial (ie. always affect a subset of the probes)  On the flip side, there are a number of benefits of making the probes stick to the same controller as long as possible. Therefore we defined a time interval (2 hours) in which the probes will keep on trying to reconnect to the same server, and only ask for help if that doesn't work out.  I hope this explains the behaviour.  Cheers, Robert""}}"
137	[atlas] Far remote probe 34512 offline but partially works		1595902705.0	2020-07-27 19:18:25	Hi team,I have probe 34512 in distant location [not able to have it checked physically for some more time], it shows offline since 2020-07-21, no SOS messages listed since 2020-05-16.But other devices connected to the same router do work online, and also the router keeps sending me Log Messages via internet so its internet connection has to be working fine.Router log shows DHCP request getting from the Probe every 12 hours, as usually:2020/07/27 18:51:44 Info 93-153-42-167.customers.tmcz.cz daemon dnsmasq-dhcp DHCPACK(eth1) 192.168.222.220 c0:25:e9:a8:57:962020/07/27 18:51:44 Info 93-153-42-167.customers.tmcz.cz daemon dnsmasq-dhcp DHCPREQUEST(eth1) 192.168.222.220 c0:25:e9:a8:57:96  The router itself is behind NAT and I'm not able to remote to it and proceed with further investigation. From the Log above I see the Probe is running and keeps requesting DHCP requests as usually, so not sure how it could show offline.Do you have any further logs or a way how to try to resurrect the Probe remotely?Thank youJiri	{}

No there haven\'t been any software updates for a very long time. For this reason they should be considered obsolete. However, we currently still support them, and we will try to release new firmware if there is a security issue.  It seems that v1 and v2 probes are now starting to die faster. I have no  idea what part is wearing out.  Unfortuantely, due to corona, we are out of v4 probes. So the best thing to do at the moment is to replace dead v1/v2 probes with software probes.

I do have a V1 probe at home, since (almost) day 1 and I had another one dying already, due to the 'ancient' software update which broke a few. So I'd like to do some contingency planning...

Probes are connected to controllers using SSH via either v6  or v4 protocols. Both protocols connectivity monitoring cannot be done this way. Instead  the measurements should be used: either UDMs or buil-ins, for example  pings to the root servers or controllers.

Thank you for the suggestion. But it is an firewalled IPv6-access.  (Vodafone/LTE)  Of course I could add some raspis just for monitoring a monitoring  tool..., but I was asking for an easier solution.  My next step will be a remote controlled power switch - so I can  hopefully restart router and probe without long down times.  Regards, Thomas'}}"

149	[atlas] Turris SW probe - long time to connect	Jan Pavlinec	1591311059.0	2020-06-04 15:50:59	Hello,Since this week based on report [1], [2] from Martin we were able to observe his issue, which he reported and by using Atlas SW Probe 5010 and older, we noticed that in CLI probe is running and that it is doing something, but on the RIPE website, it shows that probe is disconnected. Can you please check probes IDs (1000585, 1000243) and what it took so long to show that it is connected? Both of those probes were shown as connected at the same time - 20:22) on Tuesday? We noticed that in some cases if you were using the latest version 5020 and register a new probe, it is working within a few minutes.However, we pushed to all our Turris OS version updated Atlas SW Probe to version 5020 and some of our users noticed similar maybe the same behavior.  A probe was running on the router, but it was disconnected for almost an hour (probe ID 1000036)The router is working in all cases, ping, dig connection is OK.I'm wondering if this issue isn't on server side.In reg_init_reply.txt were following data:WAITTIMEOUT 115Do you know how to debug it more?[1] https://forum.turris.cz/t/turris-os-5-0-0-is-released-in-hbt/12733/149[2] https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-software-probe/issues/38Looking forward to hearing from you,Jan	{}

Some people want to use DoH from within a browser. If that gets popular, it could be that many webservers would also have DoH endpoints.  In any case, for now that might be a sensible solution. Some time ago it was proposed that the MAT working group would handle policy proposals for Atlas. So, whoever wants to make the effort to push the policy proposal through, please contact the chairs of the MAT wg on how they would like to handle this.  Philip'}}
151	[atlas] anchor on a /32 network with on-link routing ?	Matthieu Herrb	1590370185.0	2020-05-24 18:29:45	Hi,here at Tetaneutral.net we purchased an anchor with the idea to hostit in our network.For IPv4 We are using /32 addresses everywhere, and do the routing bysetting the 'on-link' flag on the default route.This configuration doesn't seem to be possible through the managementinterface. It complains that the gateway is not no the same network asthe host and provides no way (as far as I can tell) to setup the'on-link' flag.Apart from inserting another router in front of our anchor to let ituse a narrower prefix, is there a way to set it up ? Or can this beconsidered for the future evolutions of the anchor software ?Thanks in advance.-- Matthieu Herrb	{}

The scheduling process is a two-stage. First stage happens on  nearly-real-time probe data on the central scheduler then it is split  and passed down to controllers, where the probes connected to and that  have the real picture of the probes state. Based on that knowledge  controllers filter the probe list further.  There is the probe diagnostic system that use some heuristics to detect  faulty probes and tag them, it works quite well but again it is very  difficult to cover all the cases. We are working on improving that.

I could see probe was reachable on the LAN and even had a smokeping instance pointed to it which was all clean. My own internet behind the same network was working fine. Eventually found that issue was with the Ubnt edgerouter which used tweaked VyOS and in their latest version 2.0.8 it was breaking the secondary routing tables running on the device after every 4-5 days of uptime. So except the main table, rest all tables were in config but just didn\'t show up in ""show routing table X"" output. Eventually downgraded the OS version and waiting for an update in next release notes of the firmware update.

163	[atlas] Software probe using port 8080	Paul Eagles	1584132502.0	2020-03-13 13:48:22	Hi,Is there any way to change the ports that the software probes use?

164	[atlas] Software probes offline since updating to 5010-3	Paul Eagles	1583960063.0	2020-03-11 13:54:23	Hi all,About an hour ago I updated my 4 software probes (1000136, 1000137, 1000149 & 1000177) to 5010-3 from 5010-1 and they're all still showing as offline.  For each probe I went through and updated the keys within a minute or so of the installation finishing so I don't think that's the problem.It shouldn't be an internet connection issue, they're all using the same connection as they were prior to the update and prior to the update all 4 probes were connected OK.  Plus I have a physical probe at home in the same location as one of the software probes and that physical probe is showing as online.One of the software probes has been rebooted but that didn't seem to make any difference.  Checking the running processes on the host everything appears OK, I see 2 instances of the ATLAS binary running.Am I missing something or just being impatient?Cheers,Paul.

Analyze this measurements: - fetch measurement - analyze the probe locations (ie. country, continent) - create reports with average RTT from certain countries and continents  This second step I have partly in old scripts using influxdb and grafana dashboard - but that was a proof of concept with bad code.  So, before starting coding from the base - are there some available scripts which can do the second part?

This  is because in order to have enough credits to get timely checks you need  to have many times as many probes as sites to check.

I present a practical reason for implementing a DHCPv6 client on the probe.You see, my ISP doesn't send router advertisements with the prefix for stateless autoconfiguration set, and instead DHCPv6 must be used.I believe their decision could have something to do with the fact that the regulating body here requires ISP's to prevent IP address spoofing in consumer plans. And to meet that requirement my ISP may be using a feature similar to Cisco's IP source guard, where switch ports and/or mac addresses are passively associated to leased ip's or prefixes, breaking SLAAC. Unfortunately they hate letting consumers talk with their engineers so it's difficult to speculate this further.For now, I've put a stateful firewall appliance in front of the probe which provides SLAAC, it works just fine.Do you think a DHCPv6 client should be implemented?

Atlas now looks like it’s behaving the way it did before December 24 — stopping one-off measurements about five to ten minutes after they start — which suits my purposes nicely.  As far as manual ‘deletes\' go, it doesn’t look like my efforts to ‘delete\' measurements as soon as I’ve been able to pick up results are working.  There’s no need to fix this on my account — now that measurements are stopped automatically again, I’ll probably delete the attempted work-around from my code — but here are details in case they’re otherwise useful:  The process www.globaltraceroute.com follows is this:  - Create a measurement.  Get a measurement ID. - Immediately begin asking for a result every five seconds until it gets one. - Display the result to the user. - New, as of yesterday, send a ‘delete’ in an attempt to stop the measurement. - Exit  Yesterday, the measurements my code attempted to stop this way kept on running indefinitely, just as if it hadn’t sent a ‘delete’ request.  However, if I waited five or ten minutes and ran the function that sends the delete, the measurement would stop.  It was a little hard to tell that it was working because measurements would take several minutes  to show up as stopped, but when they did the timestamp for the end of the measurement would match the time I ran the ‘delete’ function.  Today, it’a again a little hard to tell what’s doing what.  The measurements are all showing as stopped eventually.  But if they had been stopped by the delete my script sent, based on what I saw yesterday I assume the stop timestamp would be within a minute or two after the start timestamp.  Instead, the delete timestamp is five to ten minutes after the start timestamp, suggesting that they’re continuing to run until Atlas with your latest fix decides they’re finished.  Measurement 23732704 is a random example of this — a measurement that was sent a ‘delete’ 50 seconds after creation (Dec 30 21:25:14 UTC), but didn’t stop until roughly five minutes later - 2019-12-30 21:30 per https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/ .  Alternatively, if you have a real time view into the Atlas API, you could go to www.globaltraceroute.com and create a measurement.  It should then show up immediately in Atlas under the scg _at_ gibbard _dot_ org username and go through the process outlined above.

I always get the following replytrying to remove any future measurement: {'error': {'detail': 'Thatmeasurement cannot be stopped', 'status': 400, 'title': 'Bad Request','code': 104}}Also, the AtlasChangeSource & AtlasChangeRequest of Cousteau [2] canonly change ongoing experiments (as I wanted to set the probes in eachmeasurement to 1 if I wasn´t allowed to delete any of them). But sincethey are upcoming, but not ongoing, I could also not alter them.I am also referring to a mailing-list post from October 2013 statingessentially the same problem [3]. Given the significant amount of timethat has passed since then I wanted to raise this issue again.Is there any way to delete a measurement that is in the ""SPECIFIED""state, which means that it will only be executed in the future?I understand that we might want to avoid deletion of measurements thathave already been run in the past in order to allow others to benefitfrom the results, but why shouldn´t one be allowed to eliminate faultymeasurements that have been scheduled by accident in the future?Thanks & a Happy New Year!Kind regards,Nils[1]https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/api/v2/manual/measurements/stop-measurements.html[2] https://ripe-atlas-cousteau.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use.html[3]https://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/ripe-atlas/2013-October/001058.html"	{}

The operations team behind anchors are keeping the machinery updated with all the latest patches, just like you\'d do with any Internet-connected server. We consider it very important when we manage these machines. They also provide very limited services (e.g. DNS and HTTP(S)).  On the other hand the very reason for installing an anchor is to make it reachable (be measured) and to reach other hosts (to measure) so forms of firewalling are counterproductive to the purpose. When in doubt, we recommend placing these ""just outside your firewall"".  Regards, Robert'}}"

189	[atlas] Long measurement delays	Steve Gibbard	1575119253.0	2019-11-30 06:07:33	"Hello, Atlas crew,I’ve been seeing delayed query responses to one-off measurements since November 22, with the exception of November 25.  For www.globaltraceroute.com, which attempts to get responses for 90 seconds after submitting a query (and is usually fairly successful), this has meant a failure rate of 61% on average for those days, and as high as 83% on one of the days.I haven’t been tracking how long it does take for a response to come in in those cases, but my most recent test measurement, measurement ID 23502037, is still not returning any data an hour and 40 minutes after submission.My request format  as a Python string is ""https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/%s/latest/?key=%s"" % (measurement_id, key).  For these failures I’m receiving an empty list, so it looks like this might be something different than the “synchronizing” issue people were complaining about over the last few weeks.  Trying to access that measurement via the Atlas Web UI, if I go to the “latest results” tab I get a spinning progress wheel, seemingly forever.I haven’t been tracking the Atlas “consumption delay” along with the results, so I’m not sure what it’s looked like during most of the failure periods.

For test, I tried to set location of my probe to Hong Kong and even if I put location pin on map in the middle of Hong Kong it still ends assigned to China. Are we still able to assign RIPE Atlas probes to Hong Kong? If not, then what about probes which are still assigned to Hong Kong? How to reliably get via API list of probes located in Hong Kong? Should we parse geo coordinates and use 3rd party libraries to figure out where probe is really located?Regards,Grzegorz	"{0: {'username': 'Robert Kisteleki', 'date_epoch': 1574963660.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-11-28 10:54:20', 'response_content': ""On 2019-11-27 14:47, Ponikierski, Grzegorz wrote: > Hi all! >  >   >  > I was wondering why I see more probes in Hong Kong marked as Chinese > probes.

Any idea?  The first thing to sort out is if the probe RDNSS handler is RFC8106 compliant.  For an LL address to work, we obviously need to know which link.  And this means that the handler must know that LL addresses are special.   Quoting https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8106#section-5.1 :     Note: The addresses for RDNSSes in the RDNSS option MAY be link-local          addresses.  Such link-local addresses SHOULD be registered in          the Resolver Repository along with the corresponding link zone          indices of the links that receive the RDNSS option(s) for them.          The link-local addresses MAY be represented in the Resolver          Repository with their link zone indices in the textual format          for scoped addresses as described in [RFC4007].  When a          resolver sends a DNS query message to an RDNSS identified by a          link-local address, it MUST use the corresponding link.  I looked quickly at an old copy of networking/rptra6.c, and it doesn\'t look like it is doing this.  I could be wrong or it could be fixed in a more recent probe firmware. But this is where I\'d start to look.   BTW, I seriously doubt that *all* other DNS and RDNSS clients got this right.  Advertising LL DNS servers seems unnecessary risky outside of the lab.  How much does a global IPv6 address cost these days?

Any idea?  I just tried a bare link local address with dig on FreeBSD and it failed. For some reason my attempts on a few linux VMs failed for completely different reasons.  The problem is that for a link local address you need a scope. The Atlas measurement code doesn't know how to add one and the addresses in /etc/resolv.conf don't have one.  I sort of knew that this was going to be a problem, but link local for the resolvers seems to be quite rare.  I'll make a note to see if I can make it work somehow.

I was, too, surprised that it works but some people tested with dig or drill (I assume it was on monohomed machines, which is the case of RIPE Atlas probes) and it worked.  Note that RFC 8106 explicitely authorizes it:     Note: The addresses for RDNSSes in the RDNSS option MAY be link-local          addresses.

It cannot prevent spoofed certificates if any CA is compromised, or fails to validate the CAA record for other reasons.  TLS clients are unable to detect spoofed certificates using CAA, since there is no sane way to map between CA certificate and the CAA record. It depends on ultimate trust in every browser root CA. CAA is mostly smoke and mirrors.  TLSA allows you to pin CA certificates or server certificates so that it can be validated by everyone. It will protect against rogue or compromised CAs. And you don't need to trust any of them.  You can pin your own certificate instead.  Yes, CAA is inferior. It would have been funny if it wasn't for the fact that people actually believe in this stuff.

I hear that.  And I see them pushing DNS over HTTPS at the same time. Doesn't really compute...  They are so good at making up excuses.

Sorry for asking this question so late in this thread, but what exactly  are the certificates used for?  The value of a certificate from a certificate authority is that you  outsource the work of establishing a trust relationship. If you\'re  connecting bits of networking infrastructure together, presumably one\'s  provisioning tools can configure each component with exactly the secrets  and trust needed, so self-signed certificates should be fine (or better,  since the system is simpler and there is no dependency on external  infrastructure).  If the use case under discussion is to help RIPE anchor operators (or  others) to see some status page on the anchor itself via a browser, then  using a ""real"" certificate might make sense. Otherwise, I don\'t see the  point.

The anchors provide very basic services intended to help users who want to use the anchors as measurement targets. They answer incoming ping, DNS and HTTP(S) queries (see https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/anchors/).

Any security audit will flag that. Rather than explain to  the auditors that there is no ‘real’ http service here, it is a  measurement device, … Jóhann suggests to put an acceptably signed  cert there. To me this sounds like a no-brainer to make life easier for  anchor hosts and not an ideological issue about which CA to use or about  other methods of securing https. So can we deploy certs that will  satisfy the security audit and get on with life?

Giovane Moura	1562362405.0	2019-07-05 14:33:25	"Folks,This page at Atlas provides a great visualization on the RTT of DNSqueries over TCP/UDP to the Root DNS servers:https://atlas.ripe.net/results/maps/root-server-performance/We can see that the RTT of TCP queries  is at least twice as long thanUDP ones (which, according to the page "" TCP is expected to be 2-3 times"" longer.I cannot replicate these results in my setup, even in large scale fromvarious vantage points: I always get very similar results for either TCPor UDP.

I assume (I didn't check with tcpdump) that Atlas starts the clock when the SYN packet leaves, and dig when the DNS request leaves. That would explain your observation.

The staff at Bytemark are both clueful and responsive in my experience. Did you try to contact them?  In what way is the peering broken?  Hmm.... I see at https://f-lga1.f.de.net.dtag.de/index.php?pageid=lg that AS3320 seems be missing all the Bytemark IPv6 routes.

AS20860 (IOMART) is the transit provider for Bytemark, and they maintain the AS-IOMART as-set which includes the AS-BYTEMARK as-set among others.  AS20860 again use AS174 (Cogent) and AS6461 (Zayo) for transit, and peers with a number of other ISPs mostly at LINX.  For some reason not AS3320 though.  But this should not matter   AS3320 is obviously peering with Cogent, and should get the routes there at least.  But they could obviously improve their connectivity a bit....  And there is something odd about their Cogent peering.  Looking for the IPv6 prefixes DTAG has received from via AS174: https://f-lga1.f.de.net.dtag.de/index.php?pageid=lg&query=ipv6+bgp+regexp¶=.*+174+.*&server=194.25.0.222&EXEC=Execute  Not much to see there.  There should have been a *lot* more routes there, especially given their lack of other peers.  > I have no much clue about bgp, as-sets, peeringdb, rpki and so on. It\'s not my  > business.

224	[atlas] When to consider a measurement finished	Wouter de Vries	1560913703.0	2019-06-18 20:08:23	Hi all,I am currently trying to do some measurements according to the followingsteps:1. create a one-off measurement2. wait for it to finish, by periodically polling the msmid and checkingthe status.3. fetch the resultsHowever, the system takes a pretty long time to set the status tofinished, even when all results are already in (maybe 10 minutes?).What heuristics/method do you recommend to determine whether to considera measurement as finished?One option I consider is to periodically fetch all results for a givenmsmid and checking if the number of results matches the number of probesassigned to the measurement. However, I suspect that causes a muchhigher load on the infrastructure.Best regards,Wouter de Vries	{0: {'username': 'Viktor Naoumov', 'date_epoch': 1560984153.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-06-19 15:42:33', 'response_content': 'Hi Wouter,  The status of one-offs is not related to results collected. The stopped  status is set by the timer after max 15 minutes. Since the measurement  scheduling is based on the best effort approach there cannot be 100%  guarantee that all the probes respond with the results so it becomes  quite difficult to set the stopped status when all probes finish  measuring. Moreover an additional lag can be introduced due to the  cluster processing. We saw situations when a measurement had the stopped  status but the results were coming.  So the workflow would be to start a measurement, allow it to be  scheduled and first results collected, then after 5-20 seconds you can  start polling it with the same or larger interval. The polling interval  should be the longer the more probes you use in your measurement.  Additionally you can estimate the data processing delay using the  https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/system/data-delay/ API call that shows the  lag in seconds and the latest received measurement timestamp.  If you want it to be truly synchronous you can use the streaming API. In  this case the results will be pushed to the client as soon as they are  coming from the probes.

225	[atlas] Probe off-line for 6 days due to bad firmware signature	Novak Jirka	1560994728.0	2019-06-19 18:38:48	"Hello,my probe 22424 is off-line due to bad firmware signature error.I try to boot it without USB stick many times, then i change the USB stick (replace the old one with new one), but it doesnt solve my problem.Could you help me?This is the information from my status page:Bad Firmware SignatureWhat does this mean?The probe's firmware signature is wrong.How can I fix this?Power-cycle the probe and wait for a couple of hours. If probe doesn't come online you should try to reinitialise or even replace your flash drive.Please use the following procedure: 1. Unplug the probe from its power source 2. Remove the USB stick from the probe 3. Plug in the probe WITHOUT the USB stick 4. Wait for ten minutes 5. Insert the USB stickIf it didn't help repeat these steps using another working USB stick that is at least 4GB in size.NOTE: This must be done on a network with working DHCP! It will NOT work if you have configured your probe to use a static IP address, because this mini-operating system does not have access to any statically configure IP addresses or DNS resolvers. If you have configured your probe to use a static IP address, the only thing you can do is move it to a network with working DHCP. When the probe is listed as ""connected"" again, it is safe to move the probe back to its original location. However, please note that we advise configuring your probe to use a static IP address only if you feel it is truly necessary to do so.Thx,Jiri"	"{0: {'username': 'Philip Homburg', 'date_epoch': 1561137424.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-06-21 10:17:04', 'response_content': 'On 2019/06/19 18:38 , Novak Jirka wrote: > my probe 22424 is off-line due to bad firmware signature error. > I try to boot it without USB stick many times, then i change the USB > stick (replace the old one with new one), but it doesnt solve my problem. > Could you help me?

232	[atlas] RIPE Atlas anchor resolver update	Anand Buddhdev	1560978823.0	2019-06-19 14:13:43	Dear colleagues,All the RIPE Atlas anchors run a caching DNS resolver. This resolver isused to look up names when a measurement requests name resolution usinga probe's resolver.We have been running an older version of BIND for this service.In the coming days, we will be upgrading the version of BIND to thelatest stable version (9.14). This version has dropped many work-aroundsfor various forms of brokenness in other DNS implementations. The effectof this is that a small number of domains hosted on broken DNSimplementations cannot be looked up by this newer version of BIND.If you are running a measurement that uses an anchor's local resolver,and you find that some domain names are failing to resolve, it may becaused by this upgrade.Regards,Anand BuddhdevRIPE NCC	{}

The reason was a broken authorisation check which in some cases prevented users (via the UI) from scheduling measurements. I believe this affected about 2% of measurement requests.

236	[atlas] RFC1918 probes	Hans Mayer	1558561249.0	2019-05-22 14:40:49	Dear All,Looking at the result of a traceroute measurement I see very often that first hop has a RFC1918 address. These days a found a result where the first 3 hops are showing something like 192.168.x.y Of course this could falsify the result especially for response time. Is there a way to select only Atlas probes which are located in non RFC1918 networks ? If not it would be nice to have such a possibility. Kind regards Hans --Ing. Dipl.-Ing.

The UI indeed has that dialog where you can include or exclude tagged probes. Suggestions should also work so typing ""1918"" also should get you there. Don\'t forget to remove the default ""any 10 probes"" default.  Regards, Robert'}}"
237	[atlas] New probe tags proposal	Antonios Chariton	1558241735.0	2019-05-18 21:55:35	Hello everyone,I believe it would be of interest to have system-assigned tags to probes based on whether their network is performing RPKI validation or not. This can be two new tags, “rpki-validating” and “no-rpki-validation”, or similar. The tags should be assigned per probe, using RIPE’s RIS Routing Beacons [1], by running system ping checks every hour / day.What do you think? Would this be something that you would find useful?

If something has 10ms RTT to target in Amsterdam, has hops with `nl-ams14a-ri1-ae8-0.aorta.net` description and has ASN for LibertyGlobal then this probe is rather in Europe.

But usually, new account creation can be scripted and fake accounts can rapidly created by a willing party. For that reason, account creation should not be the only measure against spam.    Limiting the speed of account creation based on network address can help, but can be circumvented. One big step would be physical address or ID validation. Linking the virtual and physical worlds is harder to abuse.    Another way to limit spam is to control the message. The form could give a few checkboxes or pre-defined messages but no place to write a message. If you cannot advertise stuff on the form, it\'s useless for most spammers.    Some forms can be used to DoS email by not using rate-limiting. So, that  form could limit the rate per _destination and sender_  like the Digest mode of mailing lists. One or two digests per day, and replies would be like a mailing list. I mean that RIPE would always be the sender or the receiver, ensuring privacy of email address of one party to the other.

I've also seen the limitations of (Maxmind) geolocation. and i would say it's very hard to find good guidelines on when Maxmind geolocation is better or worse then what probe hosts provide.  > So open question is: How to reliably verify location of probes OR How to > motivate RIPE Atlas users to provide valid locations and keep it up-to-date?  What i've seen for many cases of incorrectly geolocated probes is that this was caused by probes being physically moved (because the person hosting the probe moved to a different city, possibly country). One thing i've briefly looked into is if we can use a change of ASN that we see the probe in as an indicator that the probe host should be sent a reminder to check if the probes geolocation is still correct. This turned out messier then i thought (too many probes seem to cycle through two or more ASNs), but we can revisit this idea and see if we can make this work as part of a process to counter wrongly geolocated probes.  Another thing i looked into is using similarity between probes as an indicator of wrong geolocation. Intuition is that if 2 probes see the same IP path to a destination, they are probably topologically close to each other, which typically means they are physically close (but not always, eg. tunnels). So if we see 2 probes that are topologically close, but physically very distant, that probably means either a wrong geolocation or an 'interesting' setup of one of the probes.

Hi Sebastian,  I have to admit I have no idea what could be going on with your probes. With static IPv4 configuration, there is a bit of complexity in how the probes switches back up DHCP if the static config doesn't work. But your probes have IPv6 as well.  For v3 probes, there is always the possibility that the filesystem on the USB stick become corrupt, and then the static config gets lost as well. But 3 of your probes are V1/V2.  Maybe you can let me know when you plug them in a network that does have DHCP? There might be something in the probes' logs that gets reported when they connect.  Philip""}}"

The conclusion of our investigation isthat the probe upgrade process for the v3 anchor firmware has beenleaving old measurement daemons running as well as starting new ones.This means that a gradually increasing number of measurements from theaffected anchors have been performed multiple times more or lesssimultaneously. Because those processes were writing to the same file,this resulted in a lot of garbled results. Purely by chance, the weirdresult that triggered the investigation had the first part of one resultand the last part of another result in a way that generatedsyntactically correct JSON.The net result is that for the last few months, measurements done byanchors may have resulted in multiple results at roughly the same timeor no results because the results were rejected as invalid. For thosewho wish to check whether results for specific measurements wereaffected, the following links will direct you to lists of probe IDs forthe affected anchors:https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/probes/?is_anchor=true&tags=system-virtual&fields=id(VM anchors)https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/probes/?is_anchor=true&tags=system-v3-pc-engines&fields=id(v3 hardware anchors)We are working to resolve the issue and will keep you updated as andwhen we have more to report.

Hi Petr,  A couple of years ago we created a policy regarding HTTP measurements on RIPE Atlas. The concern was that probe hosts located in certain countries could get into trouble should their probes try to reach certain HTTP targets. So it was decided at the time that since these measurements do not add much to the goal of RIPE Atlas, which is to measure the Internet as a network and not the higher level protocols that run on top of it, we restricted HTTP measurements such that they are only able to target RIPE Atlas anchors.  Obviously there are benefits in measuring DNS-over-HTTPS. However, the risk for probe hosts in certain countries remains the same. For this reason, although we would be open to the creation of a new policy should there be sufficient interest from the community, there are no plans to support DNS-over-HTTPS until such a policy is in place.

We doone-off measurement where we select all probes, usually the responsivenessrates look something like:12743 Requested / 10147 Actually Participated (Taken from 18 March)But on 19 March we started seeing rates more like:12914 Requested / 7852 Actually ParticipatedWhich continued until about 28 March, when it returned to about theprevious levels:12916 Requested / 9943 Actually ParticipatedSomething funny happen with the dispatching?

If everything goes as expected, this should eventually consistent with the actual measurements results collected, with some delay.  > 12743 Requested / 10147 Actually Participated (Taken from 18 March) >  > But on 19 March we started seeing rates more like: >  > 12914 Requested / 7852 Actually Participated  Due to an internal issue, result delivery was delayed around 18-19 March: results were buffered in the infrastructure and only made it to storage later than usual. I strongly suspect this is the reason for the numbers you saw.  It\'s likely that if you sum up all the results you actually got by now, you\'ll see a much higher rate of ""actually participated"". (This assumes that these numbers come from the UI, not from your own counting in the first place.)  > Which continued until about 28 March, when it returned to about the > previous levels: >  > 12916 Requested / 9943 Actually Participated >  > Something funny happen with the dispatching? Did anybody else see?  Due to the nature of the beast, real-time data delivery is hard and delays as above can occur. These are relatively rare, and even less frequently are noticeable by users. I hope these fluctuations don\'t cause real harm to you.

Results can come after stop time (e.g. when some probes couldn't be told to stop measuring) and stop time can happen after the last results came in (e.g. in the case of one-offs).  When the results are available for download is also a different dimension; there are multiple buffering points involved, and if one of them is clogged then the results can be delayed. This is normal, especially in the case of network partitioning or maintenance work, for example.  Regards, Robert""}}"
256	[atlas] Issue with RIPE Atlas HTTP measurements	Philip Homburg	1550596985.0	2019-02-19 10:23:05	We recently discovered an issue with RIPE Atlas HTTP measurements. Intrying to fix an issue that caused the HTTP body size to be reportedincorrectly, we inadvertently introduced a bug that prevents themeasurement from working under certain conditions. This bug affectsfirmware release 4940 and the upcoming releases 4950 and 4960.The combination that fails is a recurring measurement after the firstrun with an HTTP server that returns the body as chunks. This means thatone-off measurements are fine. Unfortunately, HTTP measurements that arepart of anchoring measurements are affected.We will work to fix this issue in the first firmware release after 4960,which can be expected in the next couple of months. We apologise for theongoing issue and will keep you informed as we work to resolve it.Philip	{}

258	[atlas] shared fate for my two probes	Jay Borkenhagen	1542431807.0	2018-11-16 22:16:47	"Hi,My two RIPE Atlas probes have been acting strangely over the pastseveral months.  Very frequently I receive automatic notices from theRIPE Atlas system that both of my probes have been ""disconnected fromthe RIPE Atlas infrastructure"" essentially simultaneously.  Here's thehistory from 2018:probe 11171  2018-02-23 18:08:57 UTC.probe 11203  2018-02-23 18:10:23 UTC.probe 11171  2018-06-21 04:32:15 UTC.probe 11203  2018-06-21 04:30:59 UTC.probe 11171  2018-06-24 05:36:57 UTC.probe 11203  2018-06-24 05:37:04 UTC.probe 11171  2018-07-31 20:25:27 UTC.probe 11203  2018-07-31 20:25:32 UTC.probe 11171  2018-08-18 04:48:20 UTC.probe 11171  2018-09-15 02:31:26 UTC.probe 11203  2018-09-15 02:31:28 UTC.probe 11171  2018-10-15 23:03:50 UTC.probe 11203  2018-10-15 23:04:06 UTC.probe 11171  2018-11-16 14:42:28 UTC.probe 11203  2018-11-16 14:42:33 UTC.(Those last three events are eerily periodic.)Each time when I am finally able to visit inspect the probes (both arereported as ""Firmware Version 4940 (1100)""), their LEDs are in thesame state:--------------- Looking at the units with the on/off LED to the left:  (1) the left-most (on/off) LEDs are on steadily.  (2) the next LED is off. the next two LEDs are flashing at different frequencies:  (3) the next flashes on approx. 48 times per minute  (4) the next flashes on approx. 110 times per minute  (5) the centers of the wide ""WPS/RESET"" LEDs are on steadily.---------------Once these probes fail they remain offline until I try turning it offand on again.The probes are powered similarly: the RIPE-provided USB cable isplugged into an Apple iPhone USB power adapter, in turn plugged into astandard US 120v / 60 Hz AC receptacle.  However, the AC powercircuits feeding these receptacles come from two very differentsources which should not share fate.Until today both probes have been plugged into ports on the same Ciscoswitch, but after today's disconnect I moved probe 11203 to adifferent physical switch that has the same VLANs.None of my other equipment experiences any troubles around the timeswhen these events happen to my RIPE Atlas probes.In the past I have reported these events to atlas _at_ ripe _dot_ net, but Idoubt that the causes cited (e.g. ""the problem is with your dns"") havebeen accurate.

The fact that it happens to both probes at the same time makes it very unlikely that it is a probe specific hardware problem.  I'm not aware of any bugs in the Linux kernel that would affect IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time.  So the obvious next step is to check what actually goes over the wire.""}, 4: {'username': 'Jay Borkenhagen', 'date_epoch': 1549673670.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-02-08 17:54:30', 'response_content': 'Hi,  Following up to my own note below to provide an update:  On 23-November probe 11171 disconnected again, but this time probe 11203 -- recently moved to a port on a different ethernet switch -- did not.

However, bysetting this option, a DNS query will be sent with 0.0.0.0/0 as clientsubnet.According to the RFC, a compliant resolver which receives such contentSHOULD NOT forward the client IP to the Auth. DNS server (which the samebehavior when you set the flag to False). That's make it impossible tostudy the protocol from Auth. DNS perspective.Is there a reason why ECS is implemented that way? If it for privacy issue,the RFC recommends to sent the client IP with /24 prefix for IPv4 and /56for IPv6 to preserve the privacy.Thanks in advance!Rami	"{0: {'username': 'Philip Homburg', 'date_epoch': 1548711694.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-01-28 14:41:34', 'response_content': 'On 2019/01/28 14:33 , Rami Al-Dalky wrote: > When I tried to create a DNS measurement, I found that the only way to > send DNS query with option is to set default_client_subnet to True. > However, by setting this option, a DNS query will be sent with 0.0.0.0/0 >  as client subnet.  >  > Is there a reason why ECS is implemented that way?

However, recursive resolvers already have access to end-user IP address and there is no evidence whether or not they preserve the privacy of those queries (by sharing them with third party). If we talk about preserve the end-user privacy from Auth. DNS, those clients will eventually contact the content server (for instance, HTTP server) which would have access to the end-user IP. So there an arguement that someone can make.  If we talk about the privacy of the probes, I can't see how sending the probe's /24 would violate the privacy of the probes (anyone can harvest the public IP addresses of the probes).  > > At the same time, it was not clear to us what additional benefit it > would bring to RIPE Atlas measurements to include longer prefixes.

Yes, you can always ask for a replacement. We are still quite a bit behind in shipping probes because the transition from v3 to v4 probes was quite a bit of work.  > Or, come to think of it, replace the probe > with some code on smallish hardware, like a Raspberry Pi?  We are looking into this. There is no timeline, or even a commitment to provide this option. But we are actively preparing for a pilot.  Philip""}}"
265	[atlas] DNSEC Tag for Probes	Philippe Mächler	1548712202.0	2019-01-28 14:50:02	Hello RIPE Atlas UsersI’d like to some measurements about DNSSEC with RIPE Atlas and need away to check if the probe does DNSSEC validationThe docs mention the system-tags e.g resolvs A and resolvs AAAA. Isthere something like “system: does DNSSEC validation” if not, is thereany other way or is this on the roadmap? 😊Freundliche Grüsse / best regardsPhilippe Mächler	{}

(I\'d be particularly happy if it was, since one of the very reasons we wanted to make this whole network really open is to be able to reuse data from others\' measurements.)  If that\'s not possible, then I\'d advise you to run a small script that issues a measurement request and parametrises it with cantage point / target pairs, and use an API key for it. Perhaps also ask for a quota increase first :-)  Cheers, Robert'}, 1: {'username': 'Shane Kerr', 'date_epoch': 1548348758.0, 'date_ymd': '2019-01-24 09:52:38', 'response_content': 'Chris,  On 24/01/2019 06.39, Christopher Morrow wrote: > howdy! > So, if I have a dns server somewhere and I want to make a bunch of  > measurements: >    ""how does NYC see my dns?""

They also have filters (which I\'ve apparently sucked at reading completely!) to limit based on type/ip-version/activity/etc. mostly you can query for: ""probes near here with these sets of attributes"" which works pretty well ;)  my main problem was/is (I think) that I want to say:   ""For these M metros, please find 10 (or so) probes with working address family (v4||v6) and probe dns server (V4||V6 address) with a (non-)authoritative request""  my M number is ~70+. I didn\'t want (for some reason?) to try and gather the probes across the globe into less measurements but more probes... huh, I could try that I guess, then I\'d only have 4 measurements not M*4.

Obviously that's not great!  The probe has a v6 address, so it's solicited and received some network  config when it was booted or when your network config changed a couple  days ago. Question is, what happened next.  Guessing around the symptoms, if it's not receiving subsequent periodic  RAs (either the router isn't sending them or something is preventing the  probe from receiving them), then its local routing state will expire.  Questions I'd try and answer are: when you connect a device to the same  network, does it a) receive a v6 network & generate an address, then b)  does v6 work immediately after that, and c) does it fail after a while?

I enabled IPv6 on my Windows Laptop and it show the same symptoms - it receives an IPv6 address but is not able to reach any IPv6 target.  My setup looks like this:  Atlas Probe > Ubiquiti airRouter > provider\'s WIFI AP  When I connect my laptop stright to the provider\'s WIFI AP then IPv6 works all fine. When I connect to LAN port of my airRouter, it receives an IPv6 address but is not able to reach any IPv6 target. So the point of failure seems to be my router. It is set to Bridge mode with WIFI as a client, connected to provider\'s AP. Per the Manual: ---------------------------------------------------------- Bridge In Bridge mode, the AirRouter forwards all network management and data packets from one network interface to the other without any intelligent routing. For simple applications this provides an efficient and fully transparent network solution. WLAN (wireless) and LAN (Ethernet) interfaces belong to the same network segment and share the same IP address space. WLAN and LAN interfaces form the virtual bridge interface while acting as the bridge ports. The bridge has assigned IP settings for management purposes. ---------------------------------------------------------- The Bridge management interface shows following addresses assigned: 10.0.0.29 2A00:1028:8D1C:90DA:DE9F:DBFF:FE5C:632B/64 FE80::DE9F:DBFF:FE5C:632B/64  I would think the Bridge mode should not interfere the traffic in any way.  I have read only access to the provider\'s AP - it is cheap router with IPv4 NAT and IPv6 interfaces. It shows an IPv6 address [starting with 2a00:1028:] on its WAN IPv6, LAN IPv6, IPv6 Default Gateway, IPv6 DNS server, etc. As I said, when I connect laptop stright to the provider\'s AP, IPv6 works. I\'m unable to to setup my airRouter for IPv6 to work. It supports IPv6, but in bridge mode it has no settings available. I tried multiple factory resets, with various settings, and also tried to switch the airRouter to SOHO Router mode, then there is IPv6 Enable checkbox. While it is checked, I tried various settings, such as SLAAC, DHCPv6, etc. No go. Looks the IPv6 support in this router is broken.  It\'s a pity I cannot connect Atlas Probe v3 stright to the provider\'s WIFI eventhough it has WIFI hardware onboard. There is no way I could connect stright by LAN cable to the provider.

Based on community feedback we switched from releasing tar-balls to publishing our git repository on github.  However, this transition requires a bit more work: 1) The structure of the git repository needs to be improved. At the moment there is one branch per release. That should be switched to a release branch with tags. 2) It is not clear what should be done with the old tar files.  Note that currently we publish only the measurement source code. We are working toward releasing the remaining code (a collection of shell scripts) as well to allow people to create software probes. The complete project for making software probes possible is more involved, it requires backend and procedural changes as well.  Philip'}}"

These measurements do run on all the probes and therefore have the data for all of the probes. In the download tab, you can then select the day you want and download the results. For instance:  https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/1009/results/?start=1545350400&stop=1545436799&format=json This gives you all the results for all the probes for 21 December 2018.  You can of course also select a day in the map view itself using the time travel slider.  Again, be aware that these results are huge so you should use curl or our Python libraries to get and process these results. You can find all the RIPE NCC tools here: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC   The specific ones you want are: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-tools  https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe.atlas.sagan  https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-cousteau   Let me know if I answered your question.

I remember from RIPE 77 meeting that there are strong opinions on limiting what can be done and that there are reasons for that. Purpose of my e-mail is to find out if there is a middle ground.  Does your answer mean ""it is not going to happen, go away"" or is there a room for negotiation?  I can provide detailed argumentation if you are willing to negotiate.

In my previous email I tried ask you to more precisely specify, what tests are really *necesary* (important) for DNS flag-day compability testing. I\'m missing this information from you :-)  I think if you reduce (and explain) your needs, there\'s space for discussion. In general, proposed test is useful in my oppinion - but you\'re asking for more than you really need for that purpose, I think.

Let me clarify that [2] is low-level tool with many tests, and all of them are used for DNS flag day testing (see below).  Normal users are supposed to use form [1] which does post-processing of results from [2] and transforms it into green/yellow/orange/red signal with more human-friendly description.  The important difference here is that some test in [2] have non-binary results whilst DNS flag day [1] is concerned only with timeout/non-timeout result and ignores other details of individual tests. (In the end this distinction is not important from Atlas point of view because we either get the message back or not.)   More technical details about DNS flag day 2019 ---------------------------------------------- In short, the DNS protocol specification does not allow the server to drop (i.e. not respond at all) queries based on options in them, so the tool attempts to test if something in DNS path is dropping queries in violation of DNS protocol or not.  DNS client is free to set any flags or add arbitrary options and protocol defines what the other side should do if the flag/option is not understood. Thus, if the test passes you are safe with any version of DNS resolver (without regard to particular configuration).  Different resolvers use different set of options by default, and also the set depends on configuration. E.g. latest versions of BIND send DNS cookie option by default and it of course breaks queries to some subset of servers, which will be subject of DNS flag day 2019 (among others).   Finally to your question: Is it really needed? ---------------------------------------------- > From a quick look, you\'re missing ability to set some bits (flags) and > other options in query packet. Majority of tests in linked source code > are using SOA, some other common types in query, which are already > included in options available, some aren\'t - but they\'re quite exotic > query types and probably not widely used - so are these really needed?  For DNS flag day 2019 in particular we are interested only in queries listed at [2] and tagged with constant EDNS, sorry for not making it clear at the beginning. Of course future DNS flag days will have different requirements ... see below.  More generically, as mentioned above, the purpose of test is to answer ""will this network work with any standard-compliant resolver"" and to answer this we need to test full spectrum.  Using only subset of tests would answer sub-questions like: - will this network work with BIND 9.10 - will this network work with BIND 9.11 with cookies disabled but will not answer other sub-questions like: - BIND 9.14 in default configuration (no workarounds for non-compliance) etc.  Please note that BIND is just an example, the test matrix is in fact: V vendors * N versions * O options in each implementation, i.e. huge matrix and reducing it to minimal set is not feasible as it changes with each release.   Generalization - why are we talking about it at all? ---------------------------------------------------- Having said all that, I now realized this e-mail should have different subject - it is *also* about looking forward *beyond* DNS flag day 2019 itself.  Robert Kisteleki made clear during RIPE 77 that we are not going to get anything for DNS flag day 2019 because Atlas planning cycle does not allow to get more features in.  That\'s understood and purpose of this excercise is to find out if there are safe ways to make Atlas more useful for future DNS flag days (and other uses, of course), because in fact we are already too late for (hypotetical) DNS flag day 2020!   Problem description by example: 1. Imagine that there will be e.g. a DNS flag day 2020, 2021, 2022, etc. 2. DNS flag day is announced roughly a year before it happens to give operators room for preparation. 3. We test authoritative sides using our own tools like [2] and scripts around it [3]. It basically implements ""DNS query carpet bombing"" to ~ 23 milion domains. 4. Uncertainity which is left is question of compatibility problems in *client* networks - that\'s why we are looking at Atlas. / end of introduction / 5. Current state of things forces people who write DNS clients to specify what kind of queries we want to do for DNS flag day 2020 much much earlier than necessary for other purposes so it can get included in Atlas planning cycle. (In fact we would be already late if we wanted to do experiments now and announce it in February 2019, i.e. a year ahead). 6. Naturally if we found out that also a different type of queries is needed (which always happens once you start experimenting) it is either too late to repeat the full cycle, or we have to do experiments years before DNS flag day itself.  Such a big delay does not reflect pace of DNS ecosystem development, i.e. is good only for measurement after the fact instead of being usable as precaution/data gathering before the event. In other words we have to hope for the best and let operators to find out what the problem is because there is no way to measure it beforehand (again, in client networks).  I hope it illustrates why this limitations and problems steming from them.   Proposal -------- Proposal is to allow Atlas user to input wider variety of DNS messages in some form, and do validation on them before sending user-provided DNS message out.  This can be done in multiple ways and it up to discussion which way gives reasonable assurance the client query will not cause problem.   Assessing impact ---------------- While assessing impact of this proposal we should take into account current state of things. Even the current ability to send out simple A query for user-provided name can trigger wide variety of bugs, including security/denial-of-service bugs in DNS resolvers used by client networks.  One example for all is https://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2017-08.html (not picking on this particular implementation!)  An attacker who controls single authoritative server can trigger this bug by sending plain A query from current Atlas to DNS resolver ""under attack"". Effectivelly all resolvers have had similar bugs in the past, it is certainly not one-off.  >From this example I conclude that anyone who can buy own domain (for like ~ 6 USD/year) can mount this attack using current Atlas API, today.  In my opinion, an implementation which takes user-provided DNS message and checks it using 3 independent parsers compiled with Valgrind/ASAN (e.g. BIND, Unbound/ldns, Knot DNS, or any other) provides roughly the same level of (in)security as current limited set of options.   I hope this clarifies the case. Where do we go from here?

275	[atlas] Long response times using one-off measurements with old probes	Moritz Müller	1544824992.0	2018-12-14 15:03:12	Hi,I would like to point you to a discussion on the DNS-OARC mailing list:https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2018-December/018196.htmlOne of the operators at .ca noticed that old probes report way higher response times using DNS CHAOS queries (300% or more) (see also [3]).After some digging, we came to the conclusion that this has to do with the fact that he is carrying out “one-off” measurements.When carrying out the same query for a longer time, we cannot observe this delay.The issues seems to be that one-off measurements are scheduled at probes using a different library than measurements that run for a longer period  (“eooqd” instead of “eperd”).Some small additional delays have been documented before on the RIPE Atlas website and in research papers [1, 2], but the big delay with one off measurements was new to me.Also to others?

The old location was a cable       internet provider; the new location is at one end of a ~4.5km PtP       wireless link with fiber backhaul at the head end.          I will first ensure probe function at the new location and then,       perhaps after a week or so of stabilization, ask that it be       considered a novel probe installation. I will not have the probe       physically relocated until next weekend. I may also ask the ISP if       they would consider hosting the probe on their infrastructure core       (perhaps with a transfer).          Regards,     Gary        '}}"

You can see the status of the measurement using the API:  https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/15302198/  In this case the status is ""Scheduling denied"", which is the delayed version of the ""overlimited denied"" message that you saw with the other measurements. This is because we do an initial check when you POST and a second check when we are about to allocate probes.  The other measurement that you mentioned:  https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/15282285/  has a status of ""Failed"". In this case it is probably because the stop time is too close to the time that you scheduled the measurement so it didn\'t have a chance to run. Try increasing the stop time to a point further in the future.  The statuses of measurements are not currently displayed clearly on the web site, but that will be changing in the near future as we are overhauling the measurement details pages.

I'd like to describe why it would benecessary for my research.And if possible, may I get a temporarily limit increment for 10 days?Many thanks,Yihao Jia	"{0: {'username': 'Peter Eckel', 'date_epoch': 1532207182.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-07-21 14:06:22', 'response_content': ""Hi Jia,   did you read the mail vom Chris Amin from yesterday?

I did send an email to Chris Amin (camin _at_ ripe _dot_ net), but there might be some problem with my Gmail system and I cannot get his reply, or just because he is busy these hours.  I am sorry that I am in a hurry for this issue, and my research system involves several parts and they work simultaneously, while the limit regulation of RIPE atlas part fails the process of my whole system every day. And I really need to deal with this.  Since I haven't connected to Chris yet, could you help me ping him and loop me back in any possible way?  Thanks, Yihao  (below is the email I sent to Chris yesterday.) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Dear Chris,  Thank for helping me!  I am a Ph.D. student. The reason why I try to launch so many measurements is just for research. And I wish the rate limits could be temporarily   increased for 10 days, since I probably might exceed most of these rules.   Generally, my research is like this. --- Part 1. I have 860 targets to ping, and thus 730 measurements. And for each target, I would like to use a fixed set of 100 probes in the measurement. For each of the measurement, I'd like the target to be Pinged by these 100 probes on every 1 hour, and the measurement is planned to stop 12 hours later after the measurement start. Thus, if one probe sent 3 packets at each ping, the total credits will be 3,096,000 (730*12*100*3=3,096,000).  Part 2. This looks like a random measurement. My research is about an Internet anomalies detection system. So every time my system triggers an alarm, (the alarm would set for 1 of the 730 targets), I'd like to start an instant, and probably one-off measurement from the previous 100 probes to the alarmed target. The question is this anomalies detection system is still under improvement, so I don't exactly know how many measurements might concurrently be started at the same time. --- (The 730 targets are elaborately selected and necessary to me because I need the dataset as many as possible to examine the accuracy of the system)   I check the rules at: https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/udm/#rate-limits It makes me feel like I might exceed many rules intentionally or unintentional. Considering I am in a huge hurry to examine this system, I'd very like the limits for these rules be temporarily increased.  I appreciate every suggestion and help on this!

Eren, thank you for additional probe in Atlas network, I will for sure use it :D  I can add 2 reason that stops some people from using your probe.     1.  Some people (like me) for various valid reasons cannot use general Atlas setting for probe allocation like ""give me all probes from Ireland"". Such people use more sophisticated algorithms to use probes that they are interested in and they refresh their private probe list every X days/weeks. Your probe looks quite fresh so probably you have to wait for cronjob to update researchers\' probes lists ;)   2.  Your probe is pretty fresh so it doesn\'t have system tags like \'IPv4 Stable 1d\' or \'IPv4 Stable 90d\'. I know people that uses only probes with \'IPv4 Stable 30d\' or better. Their argument is that they want to use only stable probes which can give them comparable samples over time. And this is a good approach if you have big measurement network but I personally think that Atlas is still too small in many countries so using only \'IPv4 Stable 30d\' or better can heavily reduce number of samples that you get. Probes come and go so we should use whatever is available if our objective is to make large scale measurement globally.  In short, don\'t worry. With time you should see more measurements. Remember also that for some researches your location and provider that you use can be just no interesting.

I can confirm the low traffic too:  [http://44.128.63.10/rrdash/rrd.php?from=-2400000&to=-30&graph=atlas]  Now there are a few reasons that this could happen, but in general I believe the entire network is like this, and not just specific probes..  The reasons can be:  i) People just don’t have anything to measure, so they don’t send new measurements ii) People think credits are actually super important, and want to keep them iii) People believe current measurements are too expensive, so theoretically if everything costed 10x less, there would be 10x the measurements.  Now personally I think that it’s just (i), but I can’t actually really tell. Changing the available bandwidth from the RIPE Atlas page seems to not affect the bandwidth used. On the other hand, somehow the traffic is relatively constant at 7-8 Kb/s, and then moved up to like 8-9 Kb/s.. I do not think RIPE Atlas has 100% evenly distributed measurements, so there’s possibly some mechanism to distribute the load uniformly?

If this looks useful, please check it out and tell me what you think.One of the things I've found frustrating when troubleshooting routing problems was the lack of information about inbound paths.

But determining the full path inbound traffic was taking — why users of some ISP in Asia were having their traffic show up at one of my POPs in Europe, for instance, was much more difficult.I’ve been using looking glasses and commercial performance monitoring systems that allow traceroutes from their probes, but those often weren’t where the end users were.  RIPE Atlas did have probes where a lot of my end users were, so I started configuring one time measurements on RIPE Atlas whenever I needed a traceroute from a simulated end user.

Using the Atlas API, if you already know the probe ID, you do the trace route with two http transactions. The first one creates the measurement and returns a JSON containing a measurement ID.  The second, 30 seconds to a minute later (thus the slowness of the web app to return results) sends the measurement ID and retrieves a JSON containing the results. What I’m adding is:  - making it easier to find the right probes - turning two requests into one - supplying Atlas credits to pay for the traceroute - reformatting the JSON output into a traditional text-based traceroute output, which is easier for humans to read but maybe less useful if you’re generating the traceroutes from a machine.   Are you looking for a faster way to do manual requests and get human readable output, trying to point an automated system at it, or some hybrid of the two?  And if automated, is the human-readable output ideal, or would you be better off dealing with something a more machine readable format?  > 7) Notes at the end of the route that ""Target Address"" is anycast > address, especially for IP facebook, google, youtube and cloudflare.  I’m curious about the use case again. Also, is there a good source for that data, or would this be adding one at a time as I discover them?  >  > 8) reCAPTCHA is certainly good against abuse, but is more accountable > limits on the number of requests. It is possible, after authorization > through Google or facebook, to raise the limits of requests.  This is largely an issue of resources. Thanks to a generous donor, I have enough credits for more than a million traceroutes.  If I run through that due to human users, that will mean this is far more successful than I expect it to be, and there should be no problem either getting more donated, or coming up with a revenue model to buy them through Atlas sponsorship. But if I open it up for machine-generated measurements, it wouldn’t be that difficult for a single user to run through a million measurements.   So, I’m certainly happy to accommodate measurement by machine or in mass quantities, but need to figure out how to make it sustainable. I have a few models in mind for that, but again it largely depends on the use cases.  >  > 9) I want a correct recognition of ASN for gray IP - 10.137.128.1 > (10.137.128.1) [AS ???] >  > 10) I want a correct ASN recognition for some other IP - 185.1.50.68 > (185.1.50.68) [AS ???] 12.581 ms >   The IP address to ASN mapping is coming from MaxMind’s GeoLite2 ASN database. Putting in an override for RFC1918 would be pretty easy.  Other corrections should go through MaxMind — it will fix a lot more than just this, and I don’t think it’s scalable for me to track every error in MaxMind.   Thanks again for the feedback.

Also, does the > probe send the query to all resolvers in its list or to a subset of > those resolvers? Is DNS eyeball implemented in the probes?  Hi,  The Atlas DNS measurement code sends one request at a time, in the order in which the DNS resolvers are listed in /etc/resolv.conf on the probe.  In addition to measuring DNS, probe can also resolve a DNS name for the target of a measurement. In that case, the stub resolver that is built into libevent is used. That stub resolver does some clever and funky stuff. I don't know the details of how DNS queries are scheduled.  Philip""}}"

317	[atlas] Running a probe behind a NAT66	Roman Mamedov	1528774935.0	2018-06-11 20:42:15	"Hello,I am trying to run a probe (#73) behind an IPv6 NAT. The probe gets an IP in anon-standard prefix 66:113::/64, which is then NATed to a single GUA IPv6.This used to work fine for a few months, but then in April-2018 problemsstarted: the probe would connect to Atlas for 5-10 minutes, then disconnectfor about 20 minutes, then connect again; this alternates over and over again.However -- if IPv6 RAs are enabled some time after the probe is powered-on(i.e. the controller connection already got established over IPv4), things seemto go on fine, i.e. the controller is connected over IPv4 for days, but variousmeasurements are performed on IPv6 too. So it seems that only the controllerconnection is the problem.I fully expect that you didn't account for such a setup in the controllerinfrastructure or possibly various ""local IP is valid"" checks and whatnot, butwhy this used to work fine before?

I have no idea if that is related to your NAT box.  https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/14364300/  In general it is worth noting that Atlas has support for IPv4 NAT, such as keeping track of the public address of a probe. This support in not implemented for IPv6. So if you put a probe behind some kind of IPv6 NAT, the results may be confusing to other Atlas users.

Not surprisingly that breaks all NAT66 mappings made from/to that IP.  As also noted in my private E-Mail to Stephen, one issue highlighted here is the lack of notification about such issues with the probe. For instance I didn\'t notice that anything is wrong until almost a month later (and by then it was already difficult to pinpoint these issues to the configuration changes that I made earlier), as there is no E-Mail notification for probe connection flapping, only for 60+ minutes periods of disconnection. So perhaps it would be a good idea to consider adding more kinds of E-Mail notifications to Atlas in the future.  If anyone is curious as to why NAT66 setup in the first place, my ISP only provides a /64, and that\'s already ""spent"" on my main primary VLAN.  I don\'t want to subnet the /64 further and have to run DHCPv6 everywhere. For security reasons I want to place the probe into its own separate VLAN. So that one, as well as numerous other guest/VM/untrusted VLANs get their own 66:xxxx:/64s and are then NAT\'ed into the router\'s own IPv6.  Let me know if you have any better suggestions for these network conditions, aside from ""Get a Different ISP"" (only one ISP in my area provides IPv6) or ""Demand More IPs"" from the current ISP (very unlikely to be successful, they even allocate only /64s to business-class connections, and on residential those are also *dynamic*).  --  With respect, Roman'}, 7: {'username': 'Robert Kisteleki', 'date_epoch': 1528907933.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-06-13 09:38:53', 'response_content': ""Dear Roman,  > As also noted in my private E-Mail to Stephen, one issue highlighted here is > the lack of notification about such issues with the probe.

You can set a pretty aggressive (down to 10 minutes) notification threshold on the probe status page.

We will investigate why the country was set incorrectly while the probe was located in the UK as this normally should not be possible.

Although minor, the change may break your code if you are making use of the response.Current response example:[35878]Future response example after roll-out:{           'request_ids': [35878]}We plan to put this change into production two weeks from now.For those who don't know what Participation Requests are, they allow you to add or remove probes from a pre-existing measurement.

330	[atlas] RIPE Atlas probe status issues	Chris Amin	1524523042.0	2018-04-23 15:37:22	Dear RIPE Atlas users,There were various issues relating to the recorded status of RIPE Atlasprobes over the weekend. This was brought to our attention by internalmonitoring and information provided by users on the mailing list.Throughout this period most probes did actually remain connected tocontrollers, and measurement results were collected as normal. The sideeffects included:* the number of probes reported as connected by the system was lowerthan it should have been* the status (connected/disconnected) of many probes was incorrect* new measurements took longer than usual to start* fewer probes than usual were available for new measurements, leadingin some cases to “no suitable” probes messages when trying to schedulenew measurements* various system tags were incorrectly applied, including many probesbeing marked as having USB problems when this was not the case* temporary discrepancies with crediting/debiting of RIPE Atlas creditsfor theconnected time of probesThe issues were caused by a bug fix deployment at Friday 9AM UTC where apackage was accidentally downgraded causing a regression to an old bugin the task handling of the central system. This bug caused a backlog ofmessages to build, slowing down or stopping the registering of variousstatus messages in the system. Problems built up gradually as thebacklog increased, until the root cause was identified on Sundaymorning. The issue was then fixed and the system stabilized completelyby about 10AM UTC. We have identified procedural and technical solutionsthat will stop this problem happening again, and are looking at ways toimprove our monitoring of these kinds of issues.We apologise for any inconvenience or confusion caused by this event andwould like to thank all of you who took the time to notify us of whatyou were seeing.Kind regards,Chris AminRIPE NCC	"{0: {'username': 'Daniel AJ Sokolov', 'date_epoch': 1524753321.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-04-26 07:35:21', 'response_content': ""Thank you.

333	[atlas] paris traceroute output	Radim Hrazdil	1524539096.0	2018-04-23 20:04:56	Hello all!I'm struggling  to understand how is the number of paris variations reflected in the merasurement output.If I run paris-traceroute on my machine, the output of a single hop looks something like this:6  P(16, 16) HOSTNAME (IP):0,1,2,3,4,9,10  4.534/6.072/15.130/2.957 ms  HOSTNAME (IP):5,6,7,8  7.641/10.282/13.119/1.965 ms What I'm reffering to is this part: (IP):0,1,2,3,4,9,10, which says which probe packets  'visited' this particular router. I don't understand, how is this reflected in the measurement output. I have never encountered situaton in which 'from' fields within one hop would differ. This would suggest that no load balancing has been encountered, but that seems unlikely to me.Thanks for any replies, Radim	{}

It would be a cool system tag (although there are some issues, such as probes with two resolvers, one validating and not the other).

The strange thing is that sometimes, it depends on the probe. For instance, in #12283468, most probes succeeded but some got ""{\'level\': 2, \'description\': 40}"".

I\'ll take a look why that is and if I can get them to upgrade.  Philip'}}"

Paris-traceroute tries to make sure that all packets of a traceroute take the same route through a load balancer. This in contrast to traditional traceroute where packets from different hops typically take different routes when load balancers are involved.  However, in the case of paris-traceroute it is still interesting to find out if there are multiple routes or not. For this reason, the traceroute measurement creates different variations that may take a different route.  Each interval, it will try one variation. So if you select 16 variations then it will take 16 intervals before you get back to the first one.

I guess the only parameter needed for that is defining for how long to try finding new IP addresses in a traceroute before giving up, ie. I'll probe for 10 more rounds after I find a new IP address in a traceroute before giving up.

The way it looks to me is that that section argues that you need more than 6 and that 32 is enough.

The Atlas traceroute can perform traceroute over ICMP, TCP, and UDP. The difference here is which protocol is used to send the probing packets.  Beyond that, the 'paris' option tries to create packets in such a way that the computed flow id is stable during a run of traceroute. This can be done in different ways for ICMP, TCP, and UDP.

340	[atlas] No suitable probes error, and inconsistency between results and measurement status	Vasileios Giotsas	1524287704.0	2018-04-20 22:15:04	"Hi all,I have a number of traceroute measurements that end-up with status ""No suitable probes"". The documentation explains that this error is quite rare, the quote below is from https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/udm/""No suitable probes: The measurement cannot currently be executed as defined due to a lack of available probes. This may be because you asked to use probes that don't exist (for example, probes in an AS in which there are no probes) or because all of the probes you requested were too busy to take on new jobs. This latter scenario is very rare however.""In my case happens in all of my latest measurement request that ask for different probes. It also happens when I use the wizard in the web interface which selects the probes automatically.Even weirder, some of these measurements appear to have been completed when I check the API. For instance, measurement 12244352 has status 6 (No suitable probes), and the web interface doesn't show any results. But the API endpoint shows that it has been executed and returned results:https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/12244352/I'd appreciate some pointers on how to resolve this issue.Thanks,Vasileios"	{}

There\'s nothing you have to do when a probe is down; it is automatically marked as disconnected almost immediately, and if it isn\'t plugged back in  then it is marked as ""abandoned"" after 90 days and ""written off"" after 180 days (both of which are reversible states, so don\'t worry too much).

Ah... right. :-) The location widget on the probe detail page uses a positioning method that is linked to addresses, so you can't place probes anywhere you want.  For now I have manually set the location of the probe to the last known location of the ship.

348	[atlas] New on RIPE Labs: OpenIPmap - A Collaborative Approach to Mapping Internet Infrastructure	Mirjam Kühne	1518642404.0	2018-02-14 14:06:44	Dear colleagues,OpenIPmap, the RIPE NCC’s tool for geolocating core Internetinfrastructure, has undergone a full architectural overhaul. With a newset of APIs and interfaces designed to cater to the needs of all users,the system integrates various methods for estimating the geographicallocations of IXPs, core routers and other components of Internetinfrastructure. In this, the first of two RIPE Labs articles on thetopic, we look at the evolution of OpenIPmap from its inception to today:https://labs.ripe.net/Members/jasper_den_hertog/openipmap-a-collaborative-approach-to-mapping-internet-infrastructureKind regards,Mirjam KühneRIPE NCC	{}

The SSL check is written from scratch and does not contain all of the extensions and features you find in common SSL libraries. We do update the code as we find issues.  In this case, login.afterbuy.de just terminates the connection without sending any kind of error message.  After looking at the difference between what the atlas measurement code sends and what wget and curl do, my guess is that it is the lack of the 'signature_algorithms' extension that causes the server to drop the connection.  I will investigate if that is indeed the case. If so, I'll add the necessary code. Though it may take a couple of months before that will be available on the probes.

These tags are currently reapplied every 4 hours, so there is indeed the possibility that a probe is no longer capable of carrying out measurements with a particular address family even though it has an ""IPvX Works"" tag applied.  If you have a particular example or examples then please send them to me directly and I will take a look to see if there\'s anything strange going on.  Regards, Chris Amin RIPE NCC'}}"

357	[atlas] HTTP server configuration fix deployed to v3 anchors	Stephen D. Strowes	1516669774.0	2018-01-22 18:09:34	Hi,Recently we identified a web server misconfiguration on our v3 anchors, such that those anchors would not respond as expected to requests with their IP literal in the URL. Requests to their FQDN worked as expected.In other words:  * http://nl-ams-as3333-3.anchors.atlas.ripe.net:80/ would respond as    expected, but  * http://[2001:67c:2e8:3::c100:a4]:80/ would respond with a 404 status    code.The configuration was fixed and deployed by around 0900UTC on 16 January, 2018. V3 anchors now respond correctly to requests issued with their IP literal in the URL.This affected HTTP measurements to v3 anchors as follows:  * Before the fix was deployed, HTTP measurements to a v3 anchor with    'Resolve on probe' set to false will have used the IP literal, and    thus logged a 404 status code.  * HTTP measurements as above that were running when the fix was    deployed will have started returning correct results part-way    through their run. If the measurement is ongoing, no other action    needs to be taken.  * HTTP measurements with 'Resolve on probe' set to true always    operated as expected.Cheers,Stephen StrowesRIPE NCC	{}

For incoming traffic: the probes don\'t provide real accessible services, so incoming ICMP/ping and UDP/traceroute is probably enough (assuming the probe is otherwise not firewalled / NATed).  For outgoing traffic: the more you allow, the more measurements will have a chance of succeeding. For example, if you only allow TCP/443 out, then measurements to other ports (like TCP/traceroute or TLS to non-443) will likely fail. Allowing outgoing DNS to any server is a must in order to be useful for non-local-resolver queries. And so on.  We also have NTP since the writing of the above FAQ entry, and HTTP towards anchors. While the requirements (or, I should say, recommendations) don\'t change each day, they do evolve over time.  Hope this helps!

I see the anchor is configured to use the following DNS Resolvers  - 8.8.8.8 and 2620:74:1b::1:1.The anchor responds to pings and is reachable from the world. Also the resolvers 8.8.8.8 are 2620:74:1b::1:1 reachable from the anchor's uplink router.So apart from checking the anchor's connectivity and DNS resolvers I don't have much left to do in order to get the anchor connected again.Has anyone faced this situation before ?ThanksStanish	"{0: {'username': 'Viktor Naoumov', 'date_epoch': 1515778052.0, 'date_ymd': '2018-01-12 10:27:32', 'response_content': 'Hi Stanish,  The ""DNS Problem Suspected"" tag is set when the Atlas back-end doesn\'t  see SOS messages.

Knowing that it worked for days. Today I just tried to know if it is a network problem or a probe issu, I just conenct it into DHCP and the probe works., I also pluged my Laptop to the netwok with the static IP address (in order to know if it is a network issu) and also the network ork perfectly, I even surfed on the RIPE NCC web site without any pb.So please RIPE Atlas support, could you bring me some help?I returned back the probe to the nework, the static specified IP is kept, (with the DNS and submask and so on), but the probe didn't work.Looking for your supportMany thanks	{}

366	[atlas] Probe disconnects every 2 hours	Daniel AJ Sokolov	1513783268.0	2017-12-20 08:21:08	Hello,the logs for my probe (version 1) show that is has been disconnectingvery regularly every 2 hours. The uptimes are always +/- 1 hour 50minutes, followed by a disconnect period of 5, 8, or 11 minutes.Out of my last 25 connects, 20 are like that. 3 have double the uptime(about 3 hours and 50 minutes), only one has almost 24 hours, and thecurrent one is 6 hours and counting. The disconnects there were, again,5, 8, or 11 minutes.However, I to not notice similar disconnects as a user of the samenetwork. I sometimes listen to online streams for more then 2 hourswithout interruption. I work on my computer for more than 2 hours anddon't notice these interruptions of my internet access.It's all IPv4; no IPv6 here.

Your probe seems to reboot every two hours. V1 probes suffer from memory fragmentation, so when the ssh connection breaks, they often reboot. However I cannot find anything related to that in the logs.  A reboot can be caused by a power failure. Do you have anything that might be causing that?  Alternatively, there may be a software bug that triggers the reboot.  Other V1 probes that connect to the same controller seem fine. So either you probe gets a specific measurement that triggers a bug, or there is a power issue.  How is the probe powered?  Philip'}}

I'm not aware of any case where an Atlas probe created an IPv6 ULA out of thin air. Addresses are either statically configured or derived from a prefix in a router advertisement.  So most likely the probe picked it up from an RA. Your probe is now up for 27 days. So that's the time period where the probe could have received the RA.

373	"[atlas] Effect of ""Resolve on Probe""-option"	Tim Wattenberg	1512098873.0	2017-11-30 20:27:53	Hi everyone,I think I don’t quite understand the effect of the „Resolve on Probe“ option when creating a measurement. The form says it forces the probe to do DNS resolution, the API reference says that it indicates that a name should be resolved (using DNS) on the probe otherwise it will be resolved on the RIPE Atlas servers.Could someone explain what this means for example if I have a simple measurement for querying the A record of a given domain via the probe’s resolvers?Thanks, Tim	"{0: {'username': 'Robert Kisteleki', 'date_epoch': 1512150308.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-12-01 10:45:08', 'response_content': 'On 2017-11-30 20:27, Tim Wattenberg wrote: > Hi everyone, >  > I think I don’t quite understand the effect of the „Resolve on Probe“ option when creating a measurement.

This is more efficient, prevents DNS errors on the edges, but only works if DNS can only give one answer.  If you turn on ""resolve on probe"", then the probes get to measure the *name* you entered, and do the DNS resolution themselves every single time they measure. This has a somewhat higher chance of failure, but it\'s needed if the resolved IP depends on the location of the vantage point.

I now do understand this for all measurements exept for those of type DNS. DNS measurements with a central resolver somehow seem not that useful to me. Am I missing the use case here?  Context: I want to measure the consistency of DNS records or how they are seen inside the probes networks. In my measurement I activated the option to use the probes resolver(s) and left the option to resolve on the probe deactivated.

The documentation  appears misleading here, for the specific case of DNS.

Instead of asking for a regular name, you can query a special name like ""version.bind"" in the CHAOS class.

We were measuring ICMP-latency just from different machines on the same subnet and saw _huge_ differences in the responses:  > rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 15.088/15.202/15.366/0.155 ms > rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 4.066/4.134/4.265/0.106 ms  Those times are reproducible, a machine will always get the same 15 or 10 or 4 ms ping. So their anycasted 9.9.9.9 seems to internally redirect queries based on source-IP-hash, and if you're unlucky, they redirect you to a server at the other end of the continent, that has a latency that is worse than if you used a DNS in another european country.  What this means for your measurement is that if your probes IP changed it might suddenly get a response time that is worse by a factor, even if it was still on the exact same network. --  Michael Meier, Zentrale Systeme Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg Regionales Rechenzentrum Erlangen Martensstrasse 1, 91058 Erlangen, Germany Tel.: +49 9131 85-28973, Fax: +49 9131 302941 michael.meier _at_ fau _dot_ de www.rrze.fau.de""}, 5: {'username': 'Vesna Manojlovic', 'date_epoch': 1511460784.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-11-23 11:13:04', 'response_content': ""Hi all,  this is all very interesting, and I'd appreciate it if one or more of you would like to share your findings with the rest of the community - for example, by describing your method & conclusions in the RIPE Labs article.

Is there a vendor who > is offering it with 10G or at least in a case you could add it > yourself after?  Hi Bryan,  Quick answer: no, it doesn't support 10G. In our different board evaluations, we found that requiring support for 10G conflicts with the desire to make the box cheaper and easily available. Getting a PCIe slot on cheap embedded boards is not common - they usually support miniPCIe instead.  Longer answer: we did look, though :)  There are two options:  1) the APU3a2/4 models have a PCIe slot option, but you'd need to order it as a custom board option, and get a case made that supports it. We could not find any existing cases that would support an extra card, or any current vendors who sell the board with the PCIe slot option.  2) It might be possible to use a miniPCIe-to-PCIe extender, to borrow a 1x PCIe lane from one of the miniPCIe slots and present it on a full-size PCIe card slot. We actually did try this, but could not figure out how to make it work. And you'd still need a case that supports a card.  In the end we decided it was not wothwhile, since we wanted a model that was easily available worldwide from multiple suppliers.  Kind Regards, Colin  --  Colin Petrie Systems Engineer RIPE NCC""}}"

Even basic utilities like ""ping"" use this conversion:  $ ping 010.020.030.040 PING 010.020.030.040 (8.16.24.32) 56(84) bytes of data. ^C --- 010.020.030.040 ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms   Another way is to give a full 32-bit number as integer:  $ ping 728374928 PING 728374928 (43.106.30.144) 56(84) bytes of data. ^C --- 728374928 ping statistics --- 2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 1015ms   Or you can skip zeroes (almost like in IPv6):  $ ping 10.9 PING 10.9 (10.0.0.9) 56(84) bytes of data. ^C --- 10.9 ping statistics --- 2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 1015ms   So what you found is not a bug, but a common behavior.

It was never defined in the rfcs, but by rfc convention, leading zeros should probably be interpreted as decimal (e.g. rfc790).  The problem is, inet_aton() interprets leading zeros as octal, and on any operating system which uses the bsd socket library, the address may get converted into octal, or may not, depending on whether the program is using inet_aton(), which assumes octal if there are leading zeros, or getaddrinfo(), which will interpret as decimal in all cases, because POSIX was a bit more careful about the definition.  In other words, you have no idea a priori what someone else's code will do, so unless you're ok about your output being interpreted as random garbage, you should avoid zero-padding at all costs.

If you call, for example, strtol with the third argument (base) equal to 0, then it will parse numbers just like a C compiler.  In many contexts is is convenient if you can just type a hex number by prefixing the number with 0x.  Unfortunately, this use of strtol is so common, that it gets used even in a context where it doesn\'t make sense, such as parsing an IPv4 address.  However, the way IPv4 addresses are parsed is completely weird. This is from the inet_aton manual page:       Values specified using the `.\' notation take one of the following forms:             a.b.c.d            a.b.c            a.b            a       When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of data and      assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an Internet address.      Note that when an Internet address is viewed as a 32-bit integer quantity      on the VAX the bytes referred to above appear as ``d.c.b.a\'\'.  That is,      VAX bytes are ordered from right to left.       When a three part address is specified, the last part is interpreted as a      16-bit quantity and placed in the right-most two bytes of the network      address.  This makes the three part address format convenient for speci-      fying Class B network addresses as ``128.net.host\'\'.       When a two part address is supplied, the last part is interpreted as a      24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three bytes of the network      address.  This makes the two part address format convenient for specify-      ing Class A network addresses as ``net.host\'\'.       When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in the network      address without any byte rearrangement.       All numbers supplied as ``parts\'\' in a `.\' notation may be decimal,      octal, or hexadecimal, as specified in the C language (i.e., a leading 0x      or 0X implies hexadecimal; otherwise, a leading 0 implies octal; other-      wise, the number is interpreted as decimal).'}, 6: {'username': 'Christian Teuschel', 'date_epoch': 1509390069.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-10-30 12:01:09', 'response_content': 'Hi Max,  On RIPEstat having leading zeros in the octets is a very uncommon query pattern but since this behaviour is an inconsistency in the parsing for prefixes and IP addresses, it has been changed so that leading zeros are ignored.

There\'s more documentation available at https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/udm/#rate-limits.  Let me perhaps explain a bit more of the motivation. We started off with putting hard limits, besides other things, on: a) the number of concurrent measurements a user can b) the number of probes that can be involved in a single measurement c) the total amount of credits one can spend per day  A year or two ago we introduced a ""daily measurement result flow"" (d), with the intention of that it can ultimately replace (a) and (b), perhaps even (c). The idea behind this is that from the resource use point of view it shoould not matter (*) if one runs 1 msm with 10000 probes or 100 measurements with 100 probes each -- what matters is the total output the user is requesting from the system.  BTW (a), (b) and (c) are hard numbers, (d) is an estimate so even though it\'s more user-friendly, it\'s more difficult to maintain.  We haven\'t reached the point where (d) is the ultimate limit; mostly because there *is* difference in the (*) part above, for internal reasons. Solving this is a long-ish process, but are making steps to get there.  Hope this explains, Robert'}}"

Could these 2 things be put on separate lines? This does suggest the probe is up but only when you missed the red colour and didn’t get the meaning of the icon. Also, when you read the mail it may be hours later than when it was sent. So keep in mind that a receiver’s probe could be back online in the meantime. Often a mail will be checked on the mobile. The status on a small screen must be clear too.I’ll restart the probe and modem and it will work again but I would have done that on day 1 if the message was more clear.Thanks,Dave	{}

All these probes are actually RIPE Atlas anchors. They all run a caching recursive resolver, which can, and often is, used to perform DNS lookups for measurements running on these anchors.

Indeed, this is quite obvious now that you point it out.  In the dataset I am using (measurement 30002), there are 287 ""probes"" using 127.0.0.1 as resolver, which roughly matches the current number of anchors (290).  > The high latency in resolution could be for any number of reasons, so I > can\'t immediately it.  In case you are interested, I have attached a plot of query latency over one week of DNS measurements, showing the behaviour across the different address types of the resolvers (global, RFC1918, RFC6598 shared addresses, and loopback).  As you can see, the loopback resolver used by Atlas anchors has an incredibly bad latency!  Baptiste'}}"

You can restrict the probe to connect only on IPv4 if you want by  checking the box in the network settings for IPv4: https://atlas.ripe.net/probes/22583/#tab-network  This will make sure the probe only connects to our infrastructure using  IPv4 but the probe will still be available for IPv6 measurements.

We\'ve done the same in a study on the Roots[1]. On that time, we found 74 probes with this issue.   > Or has  > anybody already done this classification work independently?  Root Servers return a standard answer for chaos queries. So you can use  the Ripe measurements to the roots for that.  Lemme illustrate that with B-Root. B-Root CHAOS IPv4  measurement is  https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10310.  The chaos answer should either be b*-lax or b*-mia (it has two anycast  sites, Miami and LA).  Here\'s how you can do it:  1. Download part of the dataset from the measurement on B-root  (https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10310/#!download). Start with the  last 30 min or so.  2. Parse the json and extract the answers [2], you\'ll need to decode the  abuf field [3]  3. See which probes do not give the standard answers (b*-mia or b*-lax).  Another indicator I found is that usually is that hijacked probes tend  to have *very short RTTs*. Imagine a probe in Eastern Europe connecting  on b-root in LA with a RTT of 3ms.... just physically impossible. So by  coupling the chaos  answers with rtt you\'ll be fine.  Heads-up: be aware that the list of hijacked probes may change as probes  can change their locations, or ISPs change their configurations. So make  sure you use the right time frame you\'re interested.  good luck,  /giovane  [1] https://www.sidnlabs.nl/downloads/papers-reports/imc2016.pdf [2] https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe.atlas.sagan [3] https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/code/#decoding_dns_abuf'}, 2: {'username': 'Baptiste Jonglez', 'date_epoch': 1506728224.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-09-29 16:37:04', 'response_content': 'Hi Giovane,  On Fri, Sep 29, 2017 at 03:55:21PM +0200, Giovane C.

Quoting the relevant part of your IMC paper:      Moreover, we also discard measurements of a few VPs where traffic to a     root appears to be served by third parties.  We identify hijacking in     74 VPs (less than 1%) by the combination of a CHAOS reply that does     not match that letter’s known patterns and unusually short RTTs (less     than 7 ms), following prior work [23].  Did you discard probes that match *both* criteria, or just one of the criteria?  In my preliminary experiments I did notice the very low RTT, but just filtering on unusual CHAOS replies seemed to be enough.  > > Or has > > anybody already done this classification work independently? >  > Root Servers return a standard answer for chaos queries.

We only used chaos queries, since RTT suggests it but does not confirm  it The thing is that the most roots are configured with IP anycast, so  the same IP  is shared among machines across the globe, meaning that the  RTT varies depend on the relationship between the networks of the probe  and the roots.  What we did is not to run only for B-root, but for all letters (13 in  total). That\'s what did, to double check.Reference 46 in the paper gives  you measurement IDs for the other root letters.   > I was running UDM towards a public resolver to perform CHAOS queries, but > re-using the root measurements is quite clever, thanks for the idea!  Sure thing. The cool thing about these chaos measurements to the Roots  is that they are ""built-in"" measurement. That means it uses *all* atlas  probes, so you\'re covered.  /giovane'}}"

As was mentioned in the Labs article, we continue to fully support the v2 hardware and there are no plans currently to replace or phase out v2 anchors. In many cases these systems will continue to work fine for a longer time and there are currently no requirements on the side of the Atlas project that would lead us to phasing them out.  > I seem to remember > that there was an initial ""maximum supported lifetime"" set for these to > avoid the TTM issue (""10+ year old boxes still having to be supported"")...  We may come to a point in future, when we are unable to further support the remaining v2 anchors. When that happens we will of course announce that well in advance so that hosts can plan for replacements if they would want to.  Hope this clarifies things.

402	[atlas] New on RIPE Labs: Measuring your Web Server Reachability with TCP Ping	Mirjam Kühne	1506551089.0	2017-09-27 15:24:49	Dear colleagues,HTTP measurements from RIPE Atlas probes are only possible towards RIPEAtlas anchors. However, when it comes to measuring the connectivity andlatency of web servers on the network level, an alternative exists,which we call TCP Ping: a traceroute with special options that mimic theTCP handshake that takes place when an HTTP connection is established.In this RIPE Labs article we compare the results of large scale HTTP andTCP Ping measurements:https://labs.ripe.net/Members/wilhelm/measuring-your-web-server-reachability-with-tcp-pingKind regards,Mirjam KuhneRIPE NCC	{}

404	[atlas] RIPE Atlas v3 Anchor Hardware	Alun Davies	1505170485.0	2017-09-11 15:54:45	Dear all,The RIPE NCC has chosen a new model for the RIPE Atlas v3 Anchors. The hardware we finally opted for is the PC Engines APU2. As well as being cheaper than the previous generation of anchors, this model meets the majority of requirements we laid out for the next generation of anchors. To be clear, given that there are still a couple of minor logistical details to resolve, we are still keeping applications on hold for the time being. That said, we look set to meet our September deadline to resume shipping of RIPE Atlas anchors.For more information and future updates, please read our article on RIPE Labs:https://labs.ripe.net/Members/alun_davies/the-next-generation-of-ripe-atlas-anchors Kind regards,Alun DaviesCommsRIPE NCC 	"{0: {'username': 'colin johnston', 'date_epoch': 1505172204.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-09-11 16:23:24', 'response_content': 'I thought at first I was a lost sheep talking about vm probes and vm anchors but seems some people made comments in same vain on weblink below as well  Any reason why vm images and/or docker not considered ?

I’ve granted access to my colleague (Jim Gilbert) and a test group account (atlas-network _at_ akamai _dot_ com). Just to be clear, it states:Sharing Access - If you don’t want to set limits on the number of credits you share, you can also allow other RIPE Atlas users to use your credits directly for their own measurements. Select the “Share Access” tab on your credits page and enter the RIPE Atlas users you want to give access to. Users who have been given access to others’ credits will be able to choose whose account to charge when they create a new measurement from a drop-down menu. This option can also be set via the measurement API. A running measurement can be stopped by both you and the person with access to your credits. If you decide to stop giving someone else access to your credits, any measurements they have running will start using their own credits instead.This means I should be able to log into atlas-network _at_ akamai _dot_ com select “bgreene _at_ senki _dot_ org” and create/run test.

It can be pinged without any problems.But that's all. Even after 24 hours it's still reported not connected.I can see multiple LEDs:1 (power): on2: off3: slow blink4: fast blink5 (button): onI can't find that in the FAQ, the LEDs should light different.The FAQ also did mention to try first without USB and insert USB later.Or try to replace the USB. Both cases did not help.If I connect my ThinkPad instead the probe with the same network connection (cable and port), it can access the internet just fine without any problems..

However, it cannot connect to the infrastructure without one, as it does not have the needed firmware. You need to insert one a few minutes after booting.

We will continue to support the v2 anchors (""Soekris"") in parallel with the v3 anchors (new hardware) so there is no need to replace the hardware.

422	[atlas] Probe recovery does not work	Gil Bahat	1501198096.0	2017-07-27 16:28:16	Hi,I've finally managed to get a few USB drives to recover at least a few ofmy probes (I've spread about 3 dozen and only 2 are still online). But thestated recovery procedure does not work for me, with brand new 8GB keys. Isthere any good way to see what's really going on with the recovery? theprobes register themselves with the right addresses so I know connectivityand DHCP is ok, and yet they never recover.can the dhcp firmware be modified to try more aggressive recovery or betterreporting of its state?Regards,Gil	{}

425	[atlas] NSID option on the RIPE Atlas SOA measurements of the root servers	Chris Amin	1500589534.0	2017-07-20 15:25:34	Dear colleagues,RIPE Atlas is currently running a series of DNS SOA built-inmeasurements* towards all of the root servers from all probes. Duringthe recent DNS measurements hackathon** it became apparent that for someuse cases it would be useful to have SOA queries from all probes withthe NSID EDNS option set, in order to be able to match up responses withthe particular responding instances in an anycasted (or load balanced)setup.We would like to ask for feedback on two alternative options forimplementing this change. They are:1) Enable the NSID option for the existing built-in measurements towardsthe nine root servers which support it.2) Start a new set of built-in measurements towards the nine rootservers which support NSID.The advantages of option (1) are that it will be possible to compare andcontrast the two sets of results, and that historical data for theexisting built-ins will remain consistent with the current results. Avery simple analysis shows that there is no overall increase in queryerror rates through enabling NSID, but there are bound to be individualmarginal cases where queries fail or produce different results with NSIDset but succeed without it.The advantages of option (2) are that there will be no increase inresult storage usage -- the current IPv4+IPv6 UDP SOA built-ins towardsthe nine supporting root servers adds up to about 80 results per second(~1.5% of the total results in the system).This could potentially be mitigated by reducing the frequency for thesenew measurements, but perhaps more important than the slightly increasedload is thepotential user confusion caused by generating and providing two verysimilar sets ofmeasurements.Please let us know if you have any preference for which way we go onthis, particularly if you have a (current or future) use case for thiskind of data.Kind regards,Chris AminRIPE NCC* https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/built-in/** https://labs.ripe.net/Members/becha/results-dns-measurements-hackathon	{}

The biggest disadvantage of that is that you waste half your available bandwidth, but that probably isn't a big deal for the Atlas Anchors.  It is quite possible to create a setup that does 802.3ad if an LACP neighbour is detected, falling back on active/passive fail-over if not. That said, you do lose most of the error detection capabilities of LACP that way. Quite possibly not worth the engineering effort if it's not already implemented in whatever software you're using.

Linux bonding can do ARP probing on both member interfaces, which does the most important ""real world"" part of the error detection - ""will this port work for me to reach the default gateway?"" (so you can even failover on an uplink outage).  > I\'d rather you spent that time implementing LLDP support, come to think > of it. (That would be useful on the non-Anchor probes as well.)

I\'d rather go without those X pps of extra broadcast traffic on my network, to be honest. There\'s also the risk that some networks rate-limit ARP and/or broadcast traffic in general which would make the approach unreliable.  Further, it is a layering violation. In particular, if there\'s an IPv4 outage and ARPs go unanswered on one or more interfaces, that shouldn\'t have any impact on IPv6 whatsoever.  Active/passive (using link down events to trigger fail-over) is probably the way to go. KISS and all that.

I\'ve tried only a few (two?) power cycles to no avail. Finally, I\'ve got myself to snoop and check the probe\'s network activity on reboot. Following the last power cycle the v1 probe 114 has:  - acquired a public v4 IP address (DHCP) & v6 IP address (SLAAC),   recursive name server IPs, etc.; - requested a translation of ntp.atlas.ripe.net getting back responses   (CNAME ntp.ripe.net., A 193.0.0.229);  - synced time from ntp.ripe.net/193.0.0.229.123 (NTPv3); - requested a translation of U19.M${probe-mac-address}.sos.atlas.ripe.net.   (both AAAA an A records) getting back v4 & v6 address in response   (2001:67c:2e8:11::c100:1337 & 193.0.19.55); - sent an ICMP echo request to the SOS host (193.0.19.55) getting back a reply; - requested a translation of ctr-ams07.atlas.ripe.net getting back an answer   (v6 2001:67c:2e8:11::c100:1373) - talked to the controller 2001:67c:2e8:11::c100:1373 at tcp port 443   likely initiating a new FW dowload; - successfully rebooted into the newest FW 4790.

There seems to be a very rare condition where in the config on the built-in flash DHCP gets disabled.

Normally the probe receives the name of a controller to connect to. If the probe doesn't have access to DNS resolvers then it cannot connect.  We have a trick to provide the probe with either an IPv4 or an IPv6 literal. In theory the system will detect that the probe has troubles resolving DNS and will switch to that automatically.  We have to figure out why that didn't happen for your probe. But it can also be activated manually.

Perhaps this should be flagged separately? How are we doing on testing silent v6-failures in general? Happy eyeballs make a lot of breakage invisible..Geert Jan	{}
439	[atlas] Improvements to the RIPE Atlas measurement creation form	Chris Amin	1497549639.0	2017-06-15 11:00:39	Dear all,We’ve made some changes to the interface for creating measurements onthe RIPE Atlas website (https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/form/) thatwill make it both faster and more responsive. Users should also seesimilar improvements in the user interface for monitoring andconfiguring domains with DomainMON (https://atlas.ripe.net/domainmon/).The changes were made possible by switching to the public measurementAPI (https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/api/v2/manual/). Concurrently withthis, we also improved the error reporting in the API to make it easierto find out the cause of errors. This API change is backwards compatibleand is documented in the API manual(https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/api/v2/manual/overview/error_messages.html).Whilst we do not expect the transition to cause any issues, we kindlyask that users let us know if they experience anything out of theordinary that might be related to the change.Best regards,Chris AminRIPE NCC	{}

If you’ve been unable to reconnect your RIPE Atlas V1 probe, you can return it to the following address to be fixed. If you’d like the probe to be returned to you afterwards, please let us know. Alternatively, we’d encourage you to apply for a V3 probe.RIPE NCCP.O.

Too simple.  What if that anchor is down, or the anchor host network has a network bottleneck towards the transit provider you are using?  So you need something that averages over multiple anchors - we used to do that via TTM (""if our TTM hosts can reach more than 80% of all other TTM hosts, we declare the Internet to be in good working condition"" - note the ""80%"", because something is always down somewhere) but haven\'t come around to define & implement something based on ATLAS yet.

That way, if someone accruescredits they would like to transfer, we can set it up to do soautomatically once we hit 1,000,000 credits (think of it as similar to abank's auto-pay system).2. A system where, if someone needs extra credits, they can automaticallyrequest them to be deducted (with those who opt-in) from someone likemyself with unused / extra credits.3. Email notifications of when we have accrued 1,000,000 credits (myapologies if this is already a feature).I say this because I don't use my credits, so I don't want them to go towaste. It would be much more efficient if someone who needed them couldaccess them any time (assuming I already gave permission for that(opted-in)).Let me know if anyone needs clarification about my suggestions.Best,-Michael__________________Michael J.

Even though we don\'t have email notifications about accumulated credits, there\'s an API to interact with the credit system, documented at https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/api/v2/reference/#!/api/Account_GET going a long way to self-build (3).  The idea of a ""credit marketplace"" came up a few times before and so far it has mostly been handled by community interaction, i.e. users asking each other if in need or they have excess amounts. We could of course work on a more automated mechanism if this is widely considered to be a useful feature. The risk is this will evolve into a whole separate banking system, perhaps being a bigger undertaking than building RIPE Atlas itself :-)  Regards, Robert Kisteleki RIPE NCC'}, 8: {'username': 'Michael Oghia', 'date_epoch': 1496267866.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-05-31 14:57:46', 'response_content': 'Hi Robert, all:  Thanks for addressing my questions. Indeed, ""standing order"" does solve my main question. Also, I visited the API link you sent, but honestly I have no idea how to use that information (I don\'t know any code). I meant that it would just be a simple email notification when we\'ve hit a certain amount of credits (but then again, if it can do so automatically with standing order, then it\'s all fine).  On further thought, I disagree with the credit marketplace system. I appreciate that this is a service we volunteer for and the measurements are also voluntary. With that said, though, I am sure there are many unused credits that those who run many measurements could use (especially if no one uses their credits). Could this be addressed somehow?  Lastly, would anyone like to get around 1,000,000 credits from me every 5 weeks? I can set it up using the standing order process.

I guess the first step would be look at the interaction in wireshark to see what the server is sending back.  Note that at the moment, the probes do not include any SNI information.

My experience is it’s not always about the lack of connectivity, it’s about odd buffering behaviors of devices.  The Juniper M40 would buffer an incredible amount of data on the FPC for a T1 speed link whereas a OC48 FPC had the same buffer sizes for much higher rates.

Just in case someone is interested in conducting this kind of research,  IMO it would be interesting to open delay host to all internet and point  ATLAS probes to it, then vary delay time and try to find out delays at  which firewalls start to close connections prematurely.

449	[atlas] RIPE Atlas V1 Probe Issue	Alun Davies	1494976921.0	2017-05-16 16:22:01	Hello all,Due to an unfortunate bug in a recently released probe firmware (version 4760), a number of RIPE Atlas V1 probes are not currently able to connect to the network. The bug leads to excessive memory fragmentation which impacts that V1 probes because they have no MMU and only 8 MByte worth of memory. For reasons that are not yet clear, the issue has only affected well below half of the V1 probes. We are working on a new firmware that will correct this issue, but probes that will not connect will need to be returned to the RIPE NCC in order for the fix to be carried out. Once the new firmware is ready, users can either return their V1 probes to us to be fixed, or request a V3 probe instead.Thank you to Wilfred Woeber for reporting this and requesting an update on the current issue with the V1 probes.Cheers,Alun DaviesRIPE NCC 	{0: {'username': 'Alun Davies', 'date_epoch': 1495050016.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-05-17 12:40:16', 'response_content': 'A few points of clarification are warranted following the previous mail.

After a power cycle they do re-connect after a while. So I am hopeful that they may be updated eventually to the special firmware that was mentioned. Still we should offer more recent hardware to those hosts of v1 probes who want it.  Daniel'}}

I went over the results of this measurement. And the in most cases the probe was indeed still running 4760. Over time, probes upgrade 4770 and this issue will be fixed.  There are a few probes that have a timeout but are running 4770. I created a TCP traceroute measurement using the same probes of measurement 8552847. https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/8552847/#!probes  In those remaining cases, the traceroute fails to complete. So for those probes there a network related issue.  Philip'}}"

Interesting question. :) I can see the logic of this from the perspective of some operators. However, we are not considering adding 10GE or higher port speeds to the RIPE Atlas anchors. The reasons for this are manyfold:  - Though this would possibly be technically feasible with some Soekris models that have PCI Express capabilities, there would be a non-trivial and as yet undefined amount of engineering work involved for us to make this an operationally supported option. - By expanding hardware support options we increase the burden on our limited-resourced operational team. - The current GE port speed already is a significant overkill for a measurement network that is not designed to do capacity/throughput tests. As a side note: we also have a strong requirement from many of our anchor hosts in other regions of the world to keep the actual bandwidth requirements for the anchors in the order of kilobits per second or less. - Our assessment is that most of our anchor hosts (current and prospective) will be able to support 1G somewhere in their networks for at least the next 3-5 years.  I hope this clarifies our reasoning and addresses your question.

That's even easier for me to support then dealing with specific hardware.  But this is something to think about for future proofing and not requiring sponsors to find a spot and put it in more ideal locations.    Depending on cost, maybe something like moving up to 10g ports that would support 1G with sfp-t adapters.    We looked into that for our hardware and turned out we just can't do 1G on most of the hardware we are using these days.

That's why removing the probes from the measurement did not immediately remove them from the status-check.  We will review this behaviour because I can see how it is desirable to be able to immediately remove probes from the status check, and users will generally not care about results from probes that they have explicitly removed. For now your status-check does not include the old probes since they were removed more than three days ago -- if you have to remove more probes just keep in mind that the effect is not currently immediate.

In fact there are two problems:  1.       The example in the ripe_atlas_api_V2_manual.pdf is wrong  2.       The example shows using curl under UNIX; Windows requires a completely different approach to make the curl command word.     The example in the manual (page 84) shows JSON that it not accepted by atlas.ripe.net - the outer ""layer"" of JSON needs to be removed.  So rather than    \'{""probes"":[{""action"":""add"",""requested"":1,""type"":""country"",""value"":""NL""}]}\'  you need to use  \'{""action"":""add"",""requested"":1,""type"":""country"",""value"":""NL""}\'     And, while the example works on UNIX, it does not work, as shown, on Windows. It took a while to work out why.  It appears that, in UNIX the single quote is used to escape the contents in between, so what gets sent to the HTTP server is just                  {""action"":""add"",""requested"":1,""type"":""country"",""value"":""NL""}  But this ""convention""  does not work on Windows. Instead, the single quotes should be removed, and then *every* double-quote has to be escaped, with a backslash character, in order for the correct JSON to be sent to the HTTP server.     This is the corrected version of the example in the API manual for a UNIX-based system:  ~$ curl -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -H ""Accept: application/json"" -X POST -d \'{""action"":""add"",""requested"":1,""type"":""country"",""value"":""NL""}\' https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/100076/participation-requests/?ke y=YOUR_API_KEY        And this is the version that needs to be used for a Windows system:  C:\\> curl -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -H ""Accept: application/json"" -X POST -d {\\""action\\"":\\""add\\"",\\""requested\\"":1,\\""type\\"":\\""country\\"",\\""value\\"":\\""NL\\""} https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/100076/participation-requests/?ke y=YOUR_API_KEY     Apologies for the poor line-breaking in the above two examples in this email message.     colin     From: ripe-atlas [mailto:ripe-atlas-bounces _at_ ripe _dot_ net] On Behalf Of Colin Strutt Sent: Sunday, April 2, 2017 10:38 AM To: ripe-atlas _at_ ripe _dot_ net Subject: [atlas] Problems trying to add a probe to a measurement     I\'m trying to add a probe, by probe number, to an existing, running measurement, using curl, following the example and description on page 84 of the ""RIPE Atlas API v2 manual"".

462	[atlas] Measuring SCTP and DCCP compatibility	Felix Konstantin Maurer	1490227113.0	2017-03-22 16:58:33	Hi,I'm interested in measuring the support of new transport protocols in consumer routers. As IPv6 does not need rely on NAT anymore, most routers probably only have a firewall for IPv6 traffic. I assume that these firewalls drop traffic they do not understand, but I'm curious to see if it is actually true, or whether we have the possibility to use new transport protocols now.As far as I can see, there are only a limited number of possible measurements possible with Atlas probes. Do you think they could be extended to be more flexible and for example allow measurements using SCTP?RegardsFelix	{}

Dear Sylvain,  We do not support resuming a stopped measurement -- once a measurement is stopped it is frozen for good. The closest thing you can do is make a new POST request to the API based on the original measurement specification, but this will create a measurement with a new measurement ID.  Can I ask how you accidentally stopped the measurement? If it was through the website, perhaps we need to improve the UI to make it harder for mistakes to happen.

Note that it may not be a conscious choice by the probe's DNS resolver operator: it could be hijacking.  For instance, probe 32001 gets an answer from the root name server B in 3 ms, while traceroute shows a correct delay (B-root is only in the USA). And this answer is for the OpenNIC root, so this answer is certainly not from the real B-root.  (This operator, AS 23860, does other funny things.)""}}"

One for their multifunction Home Hub (Phone, TV, Internet/WiFi) and one for my personal router passing through their modem. Both are in different subnets. Hacking the Probe or the ISP router will not give access to my home network. It\'s protected from another router\'s firewall, and on another IP. And since my router has it\'s own PPPoE connection (and IP), no double-NAT.     My original question was meant from a measurement point of view. Is there a benefit FOR THE PROBE to be _in a HOME router_ ""DMZ-kinda-thing""?     Home routers don\'t have true DMZs, the DMZ is not completely on the WAN side of the router usually. It\'s confirmed by my probe\'s local IP being on the LAN side even while being in the pseudo-""DMZ"". If it was a true DMZ, it would be the WAN IP.  Martin'}}"
472	[atlas] More even earth distribution of measurement probes	Marat Khalili	1489164432.0	2017-03-10 09:47:12	I'd like to check worldwide connectivity to my site. I create a new measurement via web-interface and add, say, 300 probes, expecting them to cover most world countries. However, looking at the map  I notice that most are selected from Europe: there're two dozens in Netherlands (many with same ASNs), but only two in Australia, one in Japan and nothing in Brazil. Obviously, most ATLAS probes are from Europe, and selection algorithm does not take probe density into account.Wouldn't it be nice to have the following features in web-interface and API:* even distribution of probes by country or continent based on population, area, and other user-defined weight numbers;* avoiding probes with same ASNs?I don't know how current algorithm works, but easiest modification would be two-step process: (1) randomly select country based on specified weights; (2) randomly select probe within country, avoiding earlier selected probes or ASNs and failing if none are left available; repeat from step 1 until necessary number of probes is selected.P.S. I tried to manually request 1 probe from each country, but stumbled on unrecognised country codes, countries with no probes etc. before even trying population-weighted distribution. Without direct access to probes database nice solution can be difficult to achieve via current API, although crude one looks possible.P.P.S. I understand this option will create more load on probes in less-covered countries, but since it's possible to limit selection to specific countries anyway this is hardly a strong argument against adding this feature.--With Best Regards,Marat Khalili	"{0: {'username': 'Stephane Bortzmeyer', 'date_epoch': 1489169258.0, 'date_ymd': '2017-03-10 11:07:38', 'response_content': ""On Fri, Mar 10, 2017 at 11:47:12AM +0300,  Marat Khalili <mkh _at_ rqc _dot_ ru> wrote   a message of 94 lines which said:  > 300 probes, expecting them to cover most world countries.

Hi Hugo,  Replicating existing measurements is something which has been on our radar for a while, and we are considering options similar to that which you propose.  In the meanwhile, you can get a lot of the way towards replicating a measurement by basing your POST data on the JSON measurement spec from the API (/api/v2/measurements/{existing_msm_id}/) and using the ""msm"" type of probe selection (https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/api/v2/manual/measurements/types/in_detail.html) to run the measurement on the same set of probes (if desired).  Thanks for the feedback.  Regards, Chris Amin'}}"

488	[atlas] Querying popular domains with RIPE Atlas	Chris Amin	1486505798.0	2017-02-07 15:16:38	Dear colleagues,As you are probably aware, DNSMON* and RIPE Atlas built-in**measurements are often used when analysing outages and other issues withimportant DNS services, particularly the root zone servers. Thesemeasurements do not provide a direct indication of the impact on actualend-user experience because they involve directly querying authoritativename servers, thereby ignoring the effects of having multipleauthoritative name servers as well as caching local recursive resolvers.To improve upon our DNS monitoring, we will initiate two built-in DNSmeasurements from all RIPE Atlas probes that use the probes' defaultresolvers instead of authoritative name servers. The first measurementwill query for random top-level domains with the intention of avoidingcaches and therefore hitting at least one root name server. The secondmeasurement will query for popular domain names, with the intention ofhitting caches where appropriate and getting an idea of the true impacton users.As a starting point for the second measurement, we will use a recentsnapshot of the global top 50 visited sites according to the Alexa topsites list***, which combines unique visitors and individual page viewsin its calculations. Probes will cycle through these domains, queryingfor a different A record every 10 minutes.Since DNS queries containing these domains will be made from everyconnected RIPE Atlas probe, we would like to ask for feedback on whetherquerying the DNS for any of these domains could pose legal or politicalproblems for probe hosts in certain parts of the world.

The intention of the first measurement is to check the actual reachability of the root zone name servers from probe resolvers. This is a measurement which was requested by the K-Root operations team within the RIPE NCC, and is intended to show the reachability of the root zone servers in general given issues with a particular root letter.  These measurements will indeed be constructed in a way similar to how you suggested: .atlas.ripe.net..  Kind regards, Chris Amin RIPE NCC'}}"

496	[atlas] RIPE Atlas v1 APIs have been decommissioned	Robert Kisteleki	1484937254.0	2017-01-20 11:34:14	Dear All,As we've been announcing it for a while now (seehttps://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/ripe-atlas/2016-September/003017.htmlandhttps://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/ripe-atlas/2017-January/003128.html),the v1 APIs were to be decommissioned by the end of last year / early thisyear. This step actually happened on Wednesday this week (18 January, around14h CET). This means that queries to these APIs give 404s (for GETs) and405s (for other methods, which we may change to 404 instead).This is also the cause for the issues Stéphane was experiencing.Full documentation on the v2 APIs and other features are available athttps://atlas.ripe.net/docs/Apologies for not sending this mail already on Wednesday.Regards,Robert KistelekiRIPE NCC	{}
497	[atlas] traceroute measurement with abnormally small RTT	Wenqin SHAO	1484787715.0	2017-01-18 18:01:55	"Dear list,I recently found a ‘weird’ traceroute measurement record in the sense that:with paris id set, it has different IP addresses for a given hop;after it reached the destination, it tried one more hop;the final hop reported abnormally small RTT.I’d appreciate your views on how this happened.Here is how to identify the measurement in question: (the concerned record is as well provided at the end the mail) from ripe.atlas.cousteau import AtlasResultsRequestfilters = dict(msm_id=5010, probe_ids=[10460], start=1482177890, stop=1482177900)_, results = AtlasResultsRequest(**filters).create()It’s a IPv4 traceroute measurement toward DNS b root, 192.228.79.201.What you’ll see is:starting from hop 14, the 3 measurements for the same hop come from different IP address:hop 14: 184.105.80.202, 72.52.92.122hop 15: 72.52.92.122, 216.218.223.28hop 16: 216.218.223.28, 130.152.181.189hop 17: 130.152.181.189, 206.117.5.22hop 18: 206.117.5.22, 192.228.79.201hop 19: 192.228.79.201My first doubt is with Paris traceroute is it still possible that response IP can change due to LB mechanism on the returning path?At hop 18, the traceroute actually already reached the destination, but it continued to perform the hop 19, why?At hop 19, there is one measurement from 192.228.79.201 reporting abnormally small RTT of 0.449ms. How come? Can that happen to other measurements as well, under what circumstances?The above listed neighbouring hops always share one IP address, which makes it seem like a data formatting issue. Is there a known bug?Thanks in advance for your attention.Best regards,wenqinHere below the measurement in question:====[   {      ""lts"":-1,      ""size"":40,      ""from"":""176.227.133.141"",

returning path?  Obviously, middle boxes can do anything including changing IP addresses in packets. However, normally you see one the addresses of the router that generated the error ICMP there and the actual return path only affects rtt and ttl.  > At hop 18, the traceroute actually already reached the destination, but > it continued to perform the hop 19, why?  Traceroute continues if a hop generates a TTL exceeded. For a UDP traceroute the expected value is a UDP port unreachable.  Sometimes a middle box in front of the destination sends a TTL exceed when you expect the target to handle the packet.  > At hop 19, there is one measurement from 192.228.79.201 reporting > abnormally small RTT of 0.449ms. How come?

Is there a known bug?  There is something really weird going on here. I have no idea what is causing this.  Philip'}}
