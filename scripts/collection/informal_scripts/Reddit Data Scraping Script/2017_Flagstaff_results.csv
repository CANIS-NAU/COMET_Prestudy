Constantly dropping speeds, customer service bad on multiple occasions. I could go on all day. Im looking at SuddenLink but they dont seem amazing either. I work from home and also online gaming so i need the best.

 Personally i have had good luck with century Link. I was looking in to a isp called hospitality wireless. They use air fiber. My buddy has it and the pings were around 30-40. Through WiFi and my phone. I don't know how consistent it is over time though. You can pick your speed, might be worth trying.",,0,[],,,2,0,2
