The rent is 900/mo (including utilities and internet).
You will have your own room & private bathroom (we’d use the bathroom only when we have guests—but it hardly happens). Feel free to use the living room and watch TV (we have various streaming services). Sorry, no pets. 
The location is in West Flagstaff (Off to Route 66).
5-10 minutes’ drive to NAU, FMC, and Downtown.

I work at NAU, and my husband works at Flagstaff Medical Center. We are quiet, clean, and busy with work. We are looking for a person who is responsible, respectful, and friendly!!

0	State of Arizona	ADOT Communications Office of Community Relations	1 Jul	"Virtual public meeting slated for ADOT Electric Vehicle Plan. The Arizona Department of Transportation has scheduled a virtual public meeting on Thursday, July 14, to provide information and gather input about the ADOT Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan currently being prepared. The event is scheduled from 6 - 7:30 p.m. and can be accessed through the internet or by phone.

The plan is being developed in response to funding made available through the recently-approved federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to deploy publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) chargers along alternative fuel corridors. ADOT’s plan seeks to create a network of EV fast chargers along the state’s interstate highways, facilitating long-distance EV travel and encouraging EV adoption by more users. For those unable to attend, a recording of the meeting will be posted to the ADOT Electric Vehicle Plan website azdot.gov/EVplan. 

Join the meeting:
from 6 - 7:30 p.m. Thursday, July 14

By phone +1 669 900 6833
Webinar ID: 858 5361 3254

We also encourage you to help guide the development of the statewide plan by completing the AZ EV Plan Survey.

0	Kara G.	Bushmaster Park	17 Apr	"Shortly after we received the notice that Suddenlink had been bought out by Optimum, our monthly internet bill increased from $79.59 to $94.59 (for unlimited data, download speeds up to 400 Mbps, and upload speeds up to 40 Mbps). 

I called to complain about this increase and was told a “promotion” had expired. The rep added another “promotion” to our account that took $5 off the new higher bill, but I am certainly going to call back during the work week (when haggling with your internet service provider is more successful, according to Consumer Reports) and see if we can do better.

I’m sure a lot of you are going through the same thing, and I figure it will help all of us in our haggling if we know what our neighbors are paying now and had been paying before Optimum acquired Suddenlink. If you’re comfortable sharing, it would be helpful to know what’s included in your plan and how hard you had to haggle to get that price. (Did you get it from the first person you talked to? Or did you have to threaten to switch providers and get transferred to the retention department?)"
