0	Dana Rowden	Ponderosa Trails	14 Nov 20	Internet Outages. We recently moved back to Flagstaff after about 5 years down in the valley. We had CenturyLink previously but now have Suddenlink and I swear, we lose internet connection 1+ hours each day. Usually after 6PM on weekdays (has been about 5PM this week) and constantly throughout the day and night on weekends.

When I moved into my new house at Presidio I looked up both Suddenlink and Centurylink and noticed Centurylink had 1 gig internet which is amazing for playing video games so I chose that deal and its $65 a month + an additional $10 a month to rent the modem. I have never had such good internet and I strongly suggest looking into it especially if Suddenlink is going to increase their bill with you every year without notice. I think you can get out of your contract with a fee but that will just save you money down the road.
