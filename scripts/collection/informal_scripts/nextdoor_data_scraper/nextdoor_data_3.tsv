I called to complain about this increase and was told a “promotion” had expired. The rep added another “promotion” to our account that took $5 off the new higher bill, but I am certainly going to call back during the work week (when haggling with your internet service provider is more successful, according to Consumer Reports) and see if we can do better.

I’m sure a lot of you are going through the same thing, and I figure it will help all of us in our haggling if we know what our neighbors are paying now and had been paying before Optimum acquired Suddenlink. If you’re comfortable sharing, it would be helpful to know what’s included in your plan and how hard you had to haggle to get that price. (Did you get it from the first person you talked to?

They can't keep the service up for the full day, and can't come near their ""guaranteed speed"". I can't make it through an hour conference call without it puking. All it takes is cold or snow or clouds to bring their service to its knees.

Of course, when I ask about a credit, they say that they can't credit due to weather. Evidently ""guaranteed"" is not actually what I think it means.

0	Maryjane Arnett	Kachina Village	26 Dec	Hey guys! So a few months ago a garbage truck got caught up in the power lines and ripped some wires down from our house. I talked to the power company about how low they were hanging in the street. He assured me that Suddenlink would be out to fix them. They came out and taped two wires together, did not fix anything! I called myself numerous times to have them come actually fix the problem. Appointments were set, but still no one has come to do anything about it. We use Century Link and they can’t touch them. Now, there is a yellow caution vest hanging from them. I’ve seen two garbage trucks have to turn around in the past couple days because it got lower after the wind. I’ve tried calling again, stressing again the danger these wires present. I’ve even stopped the sheriff to see if he could call it in. Hopefully, officials calling will get them moving!

0	Michele Murphy	Woodlands Village	20 Jun	"I signed up for the Accessible Internet program through Suddenlink, a long with paperless billing and auto pay. They failed to tell me that it would take several months for autopay to begin, told me I would need to wait for a bill to get my account number to sign in online, never sent me an email or paper bill about the bill NOT being paid, then they suspended service for nonpayment! How do I pay a bill with no bill to pay, that I think is being automatically paid???? Is this typical Suddenlink customer service?
Could I have checked that the bill had been paid? Yes, and would have if I weren't dealing with a broken foot. I will be checking every month now.
