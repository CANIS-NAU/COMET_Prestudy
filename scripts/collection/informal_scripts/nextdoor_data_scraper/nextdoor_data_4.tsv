0	Kara G.	Bushmaster Park	17 Apr	"Shortly after we received the notice that Suddenlink had been bought out by Optimum, our monthly internet bill increased from $79.59 to $94.59 (for unlimited data, download speeds up to 400 Mbps, and upload speeds up to 40 Mbps). 

I called to complain about this increase and was told a “promotion” had expired. The rep added another “promotion” to our account that took $5 off the new higher bill, but I am certainly going to call back during the work week (when haggling with your internet service provider is more successful, according to Consumer Reports) and see if we can do better.

I’m sure a lot of you are going through the same thing, and I figure it will help all of us in our haggling if we know what our neighbors are paying now and had been paying before Optimum acquired Suddenlink. If you’re comfortable sharing, it would be helpful to know what’s included in your plan and how hard you had to haggle to get that price. (Did you get it from the first person you talked to?

Our issue ended up being several different things that took time to diagnose and figure out. Hopefully this helps:\n1) When I upgraded from 20ish? to 400Mbs, my modem and router were both not able to handle the change. I was getting slow speeds that didn't make sense, and when I researched it, they weren't built for the speed. I replaced them, and it helped, but I still had multiple times in the day where everything would die for a brief time...sometimes 1-2 mins, other times 2-5 mins...and it happened multiple times a day! Very problematic when you work from home and get dropped from a zoom meeting.\n2) First time they came out, they looked in the house and saw there was a signal drop. We had some older connections and some places where our cables were bent almost 90 degrees, this can cause issues. They replaced these free of charge. While this helped, we still had these drops in service, this time every few days...less than before but still annoying af. \n3) They came out a second time and looked at things and noticed the signal wasn't great. He mentioned they have oversold the area, but when I pointed out that would only cause a degradation in speed, not theses outages, he agreed. They put in a work order for the hub on our street. That got fixed (it was old as well) and while it was more infrequent, we still had outages.\n4) Finally they came out a third time. This time they looked at the connection outside the house and there was a splitter that was there. This device helped regulate the signal (it can either increase or decrease it but the goal is to keep the signal in a certain range)...it was set incorrectly. Once they switched it to the other side, everything went away and I've been having no problem at all over the last year. \n\nThe root cause was that the signal was getting outside the range, when this happened, it caused the modem to reset, which is what was causing the outages. Once we normalized the signal, it all went away.\n\nRegardless...yes, it took some time to work out and it was frustrating, but I honestly felt they were super helpful once I showed them I jumped through all their 'phone tech support' hoops...but I really saw a difference when I provided them with data and helped them with more specifics about what was going on. \n\nNow I get 400 down 40 up...during peak times that can be reduced to 200-250ish down and 20-30 up, but that is still plenty during those times. Every few months, I see a noticeable decrease in performance overall...when that happens, I reset my modem and router (takes about 5 mins) and it fixes any issues.\n\nWhile I'm not trying to defend them, trust me early on it was like pulling teeth, I have to say they came through. This was not an easy situation to figure out...\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps."", 'posted in': 'General', 'media list': None, 'comments': None, 'reactions': {'Like': ['Kathy Magness', 'Melody Gilkey'], 'Thank': [], 'Agree': [], 'Haha': [], 'Wow': [], 'Sad': []}}, {'author': 'Marc Taylor', 'neighborhood': 'Ponderosa Trails', 'date': '26 Feb 21', 'text': ""Mine fluctuates from 250 to a bit over 400.

Our issue ended up being several different things that took time to diagnose and figure out. Hopefully this helps:\n1) When I upgraded from 20ish? to 400Mbs, my modem and router were both not able to handle the change. I was getting slow speeds that didn't make sense, and when I researched it, they weren't built for the speed. I replaced them, and it helped, but I still had multiple times in the day where everything would die for a brief time...sometimes 1-2 mins, other times 2-5 mins...and it happened multiple times a day! Very problematic when you work from home and get dropped from a zoom meeting.\n2) First time they came out, they looked in the house and saw there was a signal drop. We had some older connections and some places where our cables were bent almost 90 degrees, this can cause issues. They replaced these free of charge. While this helped, we still had these drops in service, this time every few days...less than before but still annoying af. \n3) They came out a second time and looked at things and noticed the signal wasn't great. He mentioned they have oversold the area, but when I pointed out that would only cause a degradation in speed, not theses outages, he agreed. They put in a work order for the hub on our street. That got fixed (it was old as well) and while it was more infrequent, we still had outages.\n4) Finally they came out a third time. This time they looked at the connection outside the house and there was a splitter that was there. This device helped regulate the signal (it can either increase or decrease it but the goal is to keep the signal in a certain range)...it was set incorrectly. Once they switched it to the other side, everything went away and I've been having no problem at all over the last year. \n\nThe root cause was that the signal was getting outside the range, when this happened, it caused the modem to reset, which is what was causing the outages. Once we normalized the signal, it all went away.\n\nRegardless...yes, it took some time to work out and it was frustrating, but I honestly felt they were super helpful once I showed them I jumped through all their 'phone tech support' hoops...but I really saw a difference when I provided them with data and helped them with more specifics about what was going on. \n\nNow I get 400 down 40 up...during peak times that can be reduced to 200-250ish down and 20-30 up, but that is still plenty during those times. Every few months, I see a noticeable decrease in performance overall...when that happens, I reset my modem and router (takes about 5 mins) and it fixes any issues.\n\nWhile I'm not trying to defend them, trust me early on it was like pulling teeth, I have to say they came through. This was not an easy situation to figure out...\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps."", 'posted in': 'General', 'media list': None, 'comments': None, 'reactions': {'Like': ['Kathy Magness', 'Melody Gilkey'], 'Thank': [], 'Agree': [], 'Haha': [], 'Wow': [], 'Sad': []}}, {'author': 'Marc Taylor', 'neighborhood': 'Ponderosa Trails', 'date': '26 Feb 21', 'text': ""Mine fluctuates from 250 to a bit over 400.

Our issue ended up being several different things that took time to diagnose and figure out. Hopefully this helps:\n1) When I upgraded from 20ish? to 400Mbs, my modem and router were both not able to handle the change. I was getting slow speeds that didn't make sense, and when I researched it, they weren't built for the speed. I replaced them, and it helped, but I still had multiple times in the day where everything would die for a brief time...sometimes 1-2 mins, other times 2-5 mins...and it happened multiple times a day! Very problematic when you work from home and get dropped from a zoom meeting.\n2) First time they came out, they looked in the house and saw there was a signal drop. We had some older connections and some places where our cables were bent almost 90 degrees, this can cause issues. They replaced these free of charge. While this helped, we still had these drops in service, this time every few days...less than before but still annoying af. \n3) They came out a second time and looked at things and noticed the signal wasn't great. He mentioned they have oversold the area, but when I pointed out that would only cause a degradation in speed, not theses outages, he agreed. They put in a work order for the hub on our street. That got fixed (it was old as well) and while it was more infrequent, we still had outages.\n4) Finally they came out a third time. This time they looked at the connection outside the house and there was a splitter that was there. This device helped regulate the signal (it can either increase or decrease it but the goal is to keep the signal in a certain range)...it was set incorrectly. Once they switched it to the other side, everything went away and I've been having no problem at all over the last year. \n\nThe root cause was that the signal was getting outside the range, when this happened, it caused the modem to reset, which is what was causing the outages. Once we normalized the signal, it all went away.\n\nRegardless...yes, it took some time to work out and it was frustrating, but I honestly felt they were super helpful once I showed them I jumped through all their 'phone tech support' hoops...but I really saw a difference when I provided them with data and helped them with more specifics about what was going on. \n\nNow I get 400 down 40 up...during peak times that can be reduced to 200-250ish down and 20-30 up, but that is still plenty during those times. Every few months, I see a noticeable decrease in performance overall...when that happens, I reset my modem and router (takes about 5 mins) and it fixes any issues.\n\nWhile I'm not trying to defend them, trust me early on it was like pulling teeth, I have to say they came through. This was not an easy situation to figure out...\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps."", 'posted in': 'General', 'media list': None, 'comments': None, 'reactions': {'Like': ['Kathy Magness', 'Melody Gilkey'], 'Thank': [], 'Agree': [], 'Haha': [], 'Wow': [], 'Sad': []}}, {'author': 'Marc Taylor', 'neighborhood': 'Ponderosa Trails', 'date': '26 Feb 21', 'text': ""Mine fluctuates from 250 to a bit over 400.

0	Lynn Merrill	University Heights	3 Feb 21	"Suddenlink... again. Anybody else in University Highlands having a problem with Suddenlink being out again. I can't even make a phone call.

 Also, this evening my doorbell rang and I discovered a policeman standing outside my door. It seems that one of my neighbors called in a welfare check because my car has not been out of the driveway. I spent four days trying to get the snow off my car so that I could get the hood open so I could get it jumped. It would have been nice if somebody, rather than call the police, would have come over and asked if I needed any help. Maybe before you call in a welfare check you might just knock on somebody's door and ask them if they need something.  Also while they were busy watching my house, they noticed that packages stack up at my door. They do not spend the night outside, I bring them in as soon as I know they're out there. They do get stacked because I order more than one thing at a time. That's what they do with packages when you order more than one thing at a time, they stack them up. I do that because it saves me shipping. So, when I order for the dogs I order canned food, dry food, and puddle pads at the same time. That results in a stack of packages by my door. If you bothered to ask, you would know that. So nice to know that you were so caring that you couldn't bother to ask me what was going on and called the police instead. I hope this never happens to you because it's humiliating and embarrassing. I'm only posting because I want it to never happen again."

I usually have someone that comes and removes the snow but I guess because it was a Saturday they didn't feel the need. I haven't yet convinced them that I need the area where my garbage cans are cleaned out so that I can get them to the curb without having wrestling match and that I need them to remove the snow from my car.

Our issue ended up being several different things that took time to diagnose and figure out. Hopefully this helps:\n1) When I upgraded from 20ish? to 400Mbs, my modem and router were both not able to handle the change. I was getting slow speeds that didn't make sense, and when I researched it, they weren't built for the speed. I replaced them, and it helped, but I still had multiple times in the day where everything would die for a brief time...sometimes 1-2 mins, other times 2-5 mins...and it happened multiple times a day! Very problematic when you work from home and get dropped from a zoom meeting.\n2) First time they came out, they looked in the house and saw there was a signal drop. We had some older connections and some places where our cables were bent almost 90 degrees, this can cause issues. They replaced these free of charge. While this helped, we still had these drops in service, this time every few days...less than before but still annoying af. \n3) They came out a second time and looked at things and noticed the signal wasn't great. He mentioned they have oversold the area, but when I pointed out that would only cause a degradation in speed, not theses outages, he agreed. They put in a work order for the hub on our street. That got fixed (it was old as well) and while it was more infrequent, we still had outages.\n4) Finally they came out a third time. This time they looked at the connection outside the house and there was a splitter that was there. This device helped regulate the signal (it can either increase or decrease it but the goal is to keep the signal in a certain range)...it was set incorrectly. Once they switched it to the other side, everything went away and I've been having no problem at all over the last year. \n\nThe root cause was that the signal was getting outside the range, when this happened, it caused the modem to reset, which is what was causing the outages. Once we normalized the signal, it all went away.\n\nRegardless...yes, it took some time to work out and it was frustrating, but I honestly felt they were super helpful once I showed them I jumped through all their 'phone tech support' hoops...but I really saw a difference when I provided them with data and helped them with more specifics about what was going on. \n\nNow I get 400 down 40 up...during peak times that can be reduced to 200-250ish down and 20-30 up, but that is still plenty during those times. Every few months, I see a noticeable decrease in performance overall...when that happens, I reset my modem and router (takes about 5 mins) and it fixes any issues.\n\nWhile I'm not trying to defend them, trust me early on it was like pulling teeth, I have to say they came through. This was not an easy situation to figure out...\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps."", 'posted in': 'General', 'media list': None, 'comments': None, 'reactions': {'Like': ['Kathy Magness', 'Melody Gilkey'], 'Thank': [], 'Agree': [], 'Haha': [], 'Wow': [], 'Sad': []}}, {'author': 'Marc Taylor', 'neighborhood': 'Ponderosa Trails', 'date': '26 Feb 21', 'text': ""Mine fluctuates from 250 to a bit over 400.

0	Lynn Merrill	University Heights	3 Feb 21	"Suddenlink... again. Anybody else in University Highlands having a problem with Suddenlink being out again. I can't even make a phone call.

 Also, this evening my doorbell rang and I discovered a policeman standing outside my door. It seems that one of my neighbors called in a welfare check because my car has not been out of the driveway. I spent four days trying to get the snow off my car so that I could get the hood open so I could get it jumped. It would have been nice if somebody, rather than call the police, would have come over and asked if I needed any help. Maybe before you call in a welfare check you might just knock on somebody's door and ask them if they need something.  Also while they were busy watching my house, they noticed that packages stack up at my door. They do not spend the night outside, I bring them in as soon as I know they're out there. They do get stacked because I order more than one thing at a time. That's what they do with packages when you order more than one thing at a time, they stack them up. I do that because it saves me shipping. So, when I order for the dogs I order canned food, dry food, and puddle pads at the same time. That results in a stack of packages by my door. If you bothered to ask, you would know that. So nice to know that you were so caring that you couldn't bother to ask me what was going on and called the police instead. I hope this never happens to you because it's humiliating and embarrassing. I'm only posting because I want it to never happen again."

Our issue ended up being several different things that took time to diagnose and figure out. Hopefully this helps:\n1) When I upgraded from 20ish? to 400Mbs, my modem and router were both not able to handle the change. I was getting slow speeds that didn't make sense, and when I researched it, they weren't built for the speed. I replaced them, and it helped, but I still had multiple times in the day where everything would die for a brief time...sometimes 1-2 mins, other times 2-5 mins...and it happened multiple times a day! Very problematic when you work from home and get dropped from a zoom meeting.\n2) First time they came out, they looked in the house and saw there was a signal drop. We had some older connections and some places where our cables were bent almost 90 degrees, this can cause issues. They replaced these free of charge. While this helped, we still had these drops in service, this time every few days...less than before but still annoying af. \n3) They came out a second time and looked at things and noticed the signal wasn't great. He mentioned they have oversold the area, but when I pointed out that would only cause a degradation in speed, not theses outages, he agreed. They put in a work order for the hub on our street. That got fixed (it was old as well) and while it was more infrequent, we still had outages.\n4) Finally they came out a third time. This time they looked at the connection outside the house and there was a splitter that was there. This device helped regulate the signal (it can either increase or decrease it but the goal is to keep the signal in a certain range)...it was set incorrectly. Once they switched it to the other side, everything went away and I've been having no problem at all over the last year. \n\nThe root cause was that the signal was getting outside the range, when this happened, it caused the modem to reset, which is what was causing the outages. Once we normalized the signal, it all went away.\n\nRegardless...yes, it took some time to work out and it was frustrating, but I honestly felt they were super helpful once I showed them I jumped through all their 'phone tech support' hoops...but I really saw a difference when I provided them with data and helped them with more specifics about what was going on. \n\nNow I get 400 down 40 up...during peak times that can be reduced to 200-250ish down and 20-30 up, but that is still plenty during those times. Every few months, I see a noticeable decrease in performance overall...when that happens, I reset my modem and router (takes about 5 mins) and it fixes any issues.\n\nWhile I'm not trying to defend them, trust me early on it was like pulling teeth, I have to say they came through. This was not an easy situation to figure out...\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps."", 'posted in': 'General', 'media list': None, 'comments': None, 'reactions': {'Like': ['Kathy Magness', 'Melody Gilkey'], 'Thank': [], 'Agree': [], 'Haha': [], 'Wow': [], 'Sad': []}}, {'author': 'Marc Taylor', 'neighborhood': 'Ponderosa Trails', 'date': '26 Feb 21', 'text': ""Mine fluctuates from 250 to a bit over 400.
