452,"Hello,
New here, so I apologize if this has been answered (I couldn't find it on this subreddit).

&nbsp;

I recently upgraded my Verizon services to the gigabit service (TV and internet) and decided to replace my Quantum G1100 with Google Wifi. I connected the main Google Wifi directly to the ONT and got the wifi working (didn't call Verizon to switch data connection over from MoCA (Coax) to Ethernet yet).

&nbsp;

I noticed with my old configuration, I would get about 87.96 mbps down and 121.6mbps up using google's online speed test (over wifi). Now I'm getting 42.8 down and 95.9 (over wifi). When I run the speed test through the Google WiFi app, I get 761/799. Running on speedtest.net give me 99.72/121.84. Why is there such a discrepancy?

&nbsp;

I know that GWiFi works for 2.4HGz and 5Ghz, so is it possible that right now my laptop is running on 2.4Ghz? Do I have slow speeds because I didn't call Verizon to switch the data connection to Ethernet?

&nbsp;

I should note that my TV is working, but OnDemand isn't working at the moment and I understand that additional work is needed. I also need to have a 2.4Ghz band running since I have some automation products in my house that doesn't support the 5GHz speed.","slow internet, troubleshooting",troubleshooting,,troubleshooting,test results,slow internet,,
196,"Hi everyone, this has been an ongoing problem for us for the past month and a half. We've had 4 modem replacements, 5 techs come to the apartment, and multiple hour long phone calls with support, that almost always ends up with them breaking the programming. Resulting in another tech appointment to get the internet back up again. But the overlying problem is still present.

We subscribe to Bell Aliants Fiber service out here in the Halifax area, and during the day we get a rock steady 1 gig of download speeds. But during the course of the day, when it gets later into the evening our download speed drops steadily ([Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/yMAE5n1.png) [Example 2](https://i.imgur.com/MxJbeYC.png) [Example 3](https://i.imgur.com/s1z2Kx0.png) [Example 4](https://i.imgur.com/5QUvcDL.png)) All the way into the 20 mbs range. At this point watching Netflix and or YouTube becomes challenge because there is so little bandwidth left over for multiple concurrent streams, everything just buffers and lags. Not to mention just internet browsing becomes slow, and generally a real frustrating experience as we are supposed to have the full Gig of bandwidth.

It's not a WiFi interference problem as everything is hard wired. And I am checking the speed on my server that is connected directly into the hh3000. Either using speed test dot net, or the internal speed test program in the portal of the modem, making sure to check the box that blocks internet to my devices during the test. To get the most accurate result.

We were assured by many representatives  that our bandwidth is NOT shared with anyone, and we should not see any dip in our connection at any point over the course of the day. But I have multiple days of logs that clearly show a trend. As it gets later in the evening my speeds drop out.

I'm new here to r/Bell and was curious if there are any experts, or even Bell technician's that know the inner workings of how Bell/Fiber works. And could provide some information as to what would be causing this. Because with over a dozen or so people I have talked to, they have absolutely no clue why this is happening, and even worse, no clue how to fix it.

My best guess is they are having server problems on their end that they are unable to repair or identify. But if that's the case why wouldn't they just tell me that? Aren't there people maintaining the infrastructure that would have a big red light or error messages on what ever server/node/switch is having the problem? Or have a bulletin board indicating problems with services that customer support could refer to?

535,"Does anybody else have horridly unstable internet connection with AT&T? I'll try not to rant, but I'm moreso looking for anything else I could try or advise on my settings so far.

Over a year ago I moved into a different area where all we can get is AT&T (DSL), and its been pretty bad.  Keep in mind my family previously have been long time customers, and it was decent even when they had issues. I've been so mad at them the last 6 months that I don't even know what to do. We had 12 technicians to our house last year, 3 ""new"" routers including the latest (Arris BGW210-700)  on the latest firmware from what I can tell. We consistently are having disconnects 10-15 times a day, usually about 10-12 mins apart (sometimes less).  These studders and slowness are enough to disconnect our work VPNs, any TV shows we are watching etc and are very distracting. We also pay for 12mb down internet plan but we've yet to see anywhere close to that speed (usually is varies quite alot, side-by-side speed tests vary up to 50% in speed).I've made it somewhat better by bypassing AT&T's router (by sticking mine on the other end to manage the home wifi, using the AT&T router to simply provide me internet to my own personal router, something AT&T does support). That reduced the 10 min reconnect time to merely 30s to 2 mins . I've also:

* Manually Setting internet connection Type to ""DSL - Line 1"" Instead of ""Auto""
* Setting up our own router and putting the AT&T router into ""bridged mode"" enabling IP Passthrough
* Turning off the AT&T Wireless entirely so it only provides my router with internet via a CAT6 Ethernet Cable. I leave an extra cable hooked up so I can just plug in my laptop to directly connect if need be
* Given my personal router a fixed IP-address from within the AT&T portal
* Disabled the AT&T Firewall in their settings and allow my own router's firewall to take over (this fixed the issue with websites like YouTube or Facebook failing to load for no apparent reason)

While I'm not a network engineer I have dabbled in tech for many years so I am capable of doing a few things with a tutorial. These settings have reduced the length and number of disconnects but its still a horrid issue. I basically have to tether to my phone if I need any reliability (such as a Zoom or Microsoft teams call) or risk loosing connection. Unfortunately nothing AT&T have done fixed the issue, including

* Replacing the internet line from the outside ""box"" to the AT&T Router
* Rewiring the outside internet box
* replacing the AT&T router (3 times)
* Rewiring to the internet box, and again rewiring into the house

At this point I'm rather out of ideas. I've been investigating the potential of Cellular routers and moving to a data only plan, but the pricing and data caps are crazy. We don't quite get 5G in our area (its very intermittent) but I do often get strong 4G signal out my windows.

With this post I intend to recruit up to five players for weekly Zweihander games set in a homebrew world where potential for player input is very high, maintaining a serious tone with a Low to Medium Fantasy premise.

You've never heard of this system? No sweat. It's very similar to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. It runs on a 1D100 percentage system that offers a relatively low crunch, with plenty of room for customisation.

* [Click here to find out more about the system.](https://grimandperilous.com/videos/what-is-zweihander/)
* [Click here to join their official Discord.](https://discord.com/invite/zweihander)

The potential to move different systems exists. I'm a fan of dark fantasy, psychological and surreal horror, and both apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic settings. Should we get along, it'll be a fun ride for everyone involved.

You're new to roleplaying games or Zweihander? No problem at all. You are welcome to join!

# Where, When, How

* Weekly on Sundays.
* 17:00 (5 pm) GMT. [Convert your time zone here.](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20220202T200000&p1=78)
* Running for 3 to 3.5 hours.
* Discord or Google Meets (*I'm still looking for the best option*)
* Roll20 for dashboard, characters, rolls, etc.

**Requirements:**

* Functioning computer capable of running Roll20 and Voice at the same time.
* A stable internet connection. [Check your internet speed here.](https://www.speedtest.net/)
* Headset or similar microphone. [Check your mic here.](https://online-voice-recorder.com/)
* Capability to mute yourself or using push-to-talk. Nobody is interested in background noise.
* Reliable attention to the game and your fellow players for the duration of the game.

# A bit about myself

I'm a 29-year-old Italian man living in Ireland, and I've been running Call of Cthulhu games for various years before deciding to try my hands at some gritty fantasy games inspired by Warhammer Fantasy and other similar works. I like to put serious effort into my games, expecting a similar level of commitment from my players. The games I run contain silliness, but the premise often veers towards more serious and roleplay-oriented undertones.

I highly value feedback and input from my players, as I strongly feel that a cohesive and engaged group creates a better experience for everyone involved.

The above is important, because I like to brainstorm homebrew ideas for settings, house rules, etc.

# The Homebrew World

**Disclaimer:** The creation of this world took inspiration, as well as direct names, from various historical, religious, and geographical notions from the real world. These are meant to make some concepts easily relatable, and for flavour. They are not meant to appropriate or offend.

*This is a rapidly changing world treading the thin edge between an incommensurably ancient past of blood, conquest, and xenophobia; and the coming of a new age of exploration, commerce, and the spreading of new ideas. While magic is rare and faith is strong, there's something constantly gnawing at the edges of perception, something that many decide to ignore, and some decide to seek in the dark corners of the earth.*

* [Click here to enter my Notion and learn more about the ""Known World""](https://helix-cover-f95.notion.site/Zweihander-Landing-Page-188b7351c4884147bf94e41e92aeaee3)

This world is still in its infancy, and I'm sure it will benefit from *your* input and creativity as well!

For now, this is what you can expect:

**Playable Races:**

* **Ogres**. The most ancient civilization of the continent with a strong connection to nature. Their sovereign empire of old fell, leaving behind fractured independent nations.
* **Dwarves**. Dwellers of the northern tundras, whose ancient monarchies recently fell to the fires of revolution.
* **Halflings**. Southern cousins of the dwarves, who struggle to retain their regality of old against a changing world.
* **Gnomes**. A mysterious breed with no known homeland, instead living here and there, following rules of their own design.
* **Humans**. The misbegotten and defective children of the other races, lifted from oppression by the arrival of their ""gods"" Danu and Matr.

**Geopolitical Situation:**

* The once massive and insular kingdoms of old are beginning to crumble, but only few nations fully embraced this. Cultures outside of your own are still an exotic mystery, or a danger.
* Every number of centuries, the earth is plagued by earthquakes and social upheaval, plague, and misery. The humans call them Great Punishments.
* Exploration and conquest is being fuelled by the increasingly pressing need for resources, lands, and the mysterious Witchstone, as the humans call it.

**Occult and Magic:**

* Every year, more and more magic users are being born. Some see it as a blessing, others as a curse, and others still as a tool. Magic is not common, and it's dangerous.
* Occult traditions studied the secrets of the spiritual world for a long time. Recently it's as if that world had been stirring more and more.
* *Tombs of The Fallen* is the name most humans gave to those underground vaults of a world long gone; every nation, however, spends large amounts of money to find them and explore them. Why are they there?
* Tales of strange creatures and strange places abound amongst explorers, sailors, and war veterans. Conveniently enough, they only appear when nobody else seems to look.

# Expectations

**What you can expect from me:**

* To do my absolute best to provide a creative and fun environment.
* To encourage you to explore and expand the backstory of your character.
* Punctuality and organization.
* Fairness and an open mind.

**What is expected of you:**

* To actively take part in fostering a positive and fun environment.
* To roleplay, instead of simply rolling dice. Know your character.
* To be punctual and to provide advance notice if not able to attend.
* To not engage in power-play and/or disruptive behaviour.

**You must be ok with:**

* Adult content such as violence, various types of horror, drama, etc.
* A homebrew world where things may be mutable.
* Having your character facing serious risks of sanity and safety.
* GM and Players not being native English speakers. Understand and make yourself understandable.
* I'm new to the system. I might not know the rules like the back of my hand.
* The Zweihander system uses random rolls to determine what kind of character you end up playing, and what initial occupation. It's a prime opportunity for Roleplay, but you must be aware of it.

PureVPN Review: Is PureVPN really as fast as they say?

According to their website, PureVPN is the world's fastest VPN. This is quite a big claim so let us take a further look at what other features this service has to offer. What first got my attention was their slogan:

""The World's Fastest VPN Service. That Means Faster Internet, More Secure & More Privacy.""

When I first read this line, I couldn't help but think that they must be overselling themselves a bit with such a bold statement. However, after having tested out their servers and services with several different VPN speed testing services, I can say that the results are fairly consistent with what they claim.

PureVPN claims to be a global VPN provider with servers in over 140 countries. I was fairly surprised to find out that their service really is as fast as they claim it to be. In my own tests, I found PureVPN's speeds on par with even the fastest VPN providers like NordVPN.

## PureVPN Review: Server Network

The reason for the speed boost is quite simple when you think about it. Most VPN services slow down your internet speed by encrypting and rerouting all of your online traffic from the ISP servers to their own servers before forwarding them to their final destination. This creates a bottleneck that reduces speeds dramatically.

PureVPN, on the other hand, uses a special Chameleon protocol together with AES-256 bit encryption and SHA512 authentication to ensure your internet speed is not bottlenecked by their services. They also offer exclusive features such as ""split tunneling"" and custom proxy modules for increased anonymity and security online.

PureVPN's server network is built entirely on bare metal so you won't be losing any speed due to the virtualization of hosting servers as some VPN providers do. Their expansive list of locations includes the United States, UK, Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and many more countries in Europe and Asia. You can find the full list of locations here.

## PureVPN Review: Features

PureVPN offers all the main features you have come to expect in a VPN service. IPv6, DNS leak protection, DDoS protection, Port forwarding, etc. are just some of the common features that PureVPN supports. They also offer great apps for every major platform including Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android devices.

One unique feature they offer is split tunneling which allows you to decide which traffic goes through their servers and which one can travel free on your ISP's network without encryption or modification. This way you don't have to choose between security or speed when connecting to PureVPN servers which makes it perfect for users especially ex-pats who are constantly streaming content online from different regions around the world where internet speeds might be much faster than the ones they are used to.

## PureVPN Review: Pricing & Plans

At the moment, PureVPN offers 3 types of plans with monthly subscriptions as well as a very affordable yearly plan which actually lowers down the cost significantly. They do not offer shorter durations for their subscription plans, however, if you are not comfortable signing up for a longer period of time, there are other providers out there that provide shorter packages such as VyprVPN and NordVPN.

The pricing is one of the most attractive features of PureVPN. Not only do they have great discounts over their larger competitors but it allows users to try out the full service without breaking their wallet or bank account. The cheapest package starts at $2/month which makes it very appealing to users who want a reliable VPN service but don't have the luxury of spending more on one.

## PureVPN Review: Customer Support

PureVPN offers an extensive library of tutorials, manuals, and guides about their VPN services that you can access directly through their website. They also offer 24/7 live chat support which is quite rare among the other leading VPN providers out there. While they do lack a bit in ticket response time compared to some other bigger names in the industry, their quality nonetheless is very professional and helpful to those seeking answers or support with their service.

I wouldn't consider this to be a downside as it should come as no surprise that nobody can guarantee 100% response time for every single customer inquiry as many would disagree with me on this point. PureVPN is very transparent about this information, however, so it's definitely not a concern for most users.

## PureVPN Review: Speed Test Results

I performed several speed tests over the past month using Â Speed of. me and OpenSpeedtest to gather accurate results on expected download speeds without any throttling from the VPN provider in question. I found out that my ISP was throttling services such as Netflix due to their ongoing battle with the streaming giant which inevitably ends up affecting gamers who like to stream live content online regular basis.

The first test was conducted after connecting to one of PureVPN's UK servers:

As you can see my download speeds were pretty impressive and maxed out at around 30 Mbps which is more than enough to stream HD content without any lags or interruptions.

The second test was conducted after connecting to a PureVPN server located in Canada:

The results from this test were equally as impressive, again my download speeds maxed out at around 30 Mbps which is more than enough for HD quality streaming without any buffering issues whatsoever.

I also tested the connection speeds with the VPN turned off and as expected it yielded much slower results due to ISP throttling. Download speeds dropped down to around 1-2Mbps which makes it almost impossible for me to stream anything online let alone have an enjoyable gaming experience.

## PureVPN Review: Pros & Cons

\+ Exceptional prices! With a yearly subscription, you can expect your bill to be well under $50.

\+ Very stable and reliable speeds on all servers no matter the location or time of day.Â 

\+ Large number of VPN servers in different countries around the world to choose from.

\- No refund policy whatsoever, not even for yearly subscriptions which is a big negative for me personally.

\- Does not accept Bitcoin or other Cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, only PayPal & Paymentwall. Would have liked to see more options available for anonymous users who want complete privacy when signing up with their service provider.

## PureVPN Review: Conclusion

All in all, I was very satisfied with PureVPN's performance during my time testing out their services over the past month or so. They are an attractive alternative to some of the more established providers in the industry due to their cheap prices and impressive speeds for gaming, streaming videos, and music online.

I wouldn't consider this to be a downside as it should come as no surprise that nobody can guarantee 100% response time for every single customer inquiry as many would disagree with me on this point. PureVPN is very transparent about this information, however, so it's definitely not a concern for most users.",not related,Not related,,not related,,,,

477,"The SFP+ Wan port is finicky on the UDM Pro. This has been mostly noticeable with those going from the AT&T router and others that only have a 5Gbe port and was thought to be an issue with the SFP+ RJ45 modules downrating the speed. As you noticed, download speeds would be fine but upload speeds would crater.

The HH4000 does have a 10Gbe port as you noticed, so in theory the Ubiquiti RJ45+ module that only does 10Gbe and 1Gbe should be  fine as you aren't downrating the connection from 10Gbe. It could also be no one has actually tested that module and it's just another one in the large pile of SFP+ RJ45 modules that the WAN SFP+ port doesn't like.

The first thing I would do is connect a computer directly to the hh4000 and run a speed test just to absolutely confirm it isn't the connection. I'd then potentially start looking at trying another SFP+ RJ45 module.

869,"Hi r/techsupport,

I'm having issues with my internet connection which manifests when gaming.

I have a Deco X60 which is being used as a router and is plugged directly into the ONT. I have a switch plugged into that to allow to PCs to be connected via cable, so my wife and I can theoretically play at the same time with minimum lag, but that doesn't seem to be what is happening.

Her computer connects fine, whereas mine seems to get a much choppier connection. We have a 100/20 Mbps fibre connection and looking at the Deco app I can see her computer regularly has close to that maximum, while mine is usually trailing well behind with a 5 or 6 kbps connection while I'm gaming. However if I run a speedtest on my PC, it will shoot up to 100/20 before dropping back down.

I've tried removing the switch and plugging my computer into the router directly, and connecting via a wifi USB dongle, but still have pretty abysmal speed according to the app. I've also tried playing around with the priority settings of the network to give my PC max priority over everything else, but still the same problem. My network card drivers are up to date.

I'm going to try setting up a different modem because I don't recall this being an issue before the new router, but outside of this the X60 is much better for everything else I use the internet for so ideally I can get it going on there. There's also the chance it was already happening but I didn't notice as much because we were gaming at the same time and I didn't have the app to check connection speeds.

Is there anything specific to my computer or to the X60 that could be causing this? We've never really gone into playing around with NAT types or port settings so as far as I'm aware we should have a pretty similar connection to the network.","troubleshooting, advice, recommendations, slow internet","troubleshooting, hardware differences",,troubleshooting,test results,slow internet,gaming,

577,"I had 50 mbps internet before and sure enough at my desktop connecting to the router (which is in the living room, about ten feet away) over wifi I was getting \~50 mbps on speed tests. My ISP gave me a free upgrade to 100 mpbs, cool beans I thought. I had to buy a new modem to take advantage (a 16X4 modem, my old modem was 4X4). However minutes ago I got that setup and my PC is still getting....\~50 mpbs on speed tests.

â€‹

Immediately I tested my Xbox, because it's directly wired into my router. Sure enough, it was getting >50 mbps when downloading a large game. Sure it was varying because of server speed, but 80 mbps was common and sustained, and sometimes it approached 100 mbps. About what I would except for a 100 mbps connection.

â€‹

So clearly the bottleneck is in my wifi somewhere. I have an older linksys wireless N router. And a also older newegg branded wireless N USB (2.0) wifi adapter on my PC. I initially suspected maybe the USB 2.0 my PC's wifi adapter was plugged into could be an issue as well.

â€‹

All of these advertise 300 mpbs speed on the labels. even allowing that this is theoretical and not ""real world"", it sure seems like I should be doing over 50 mbps on these devices...

â€‹

I also have a somewhat older chromebook, so I tested it as well. It too was only getting \~50 mbps over it's built in wifi. This seemed to eliminate the USB 2.0 on my PC wifi adapter as an issue. I did notice if I moved the Chromebook right next to the router, like a foot away, I could get slightly faster speed, maybe 55-56 mbps. Still not where I'd want it.

â€‹

So what's the issue? Is it multiple devices? On the same (only) linksys router I have my Xbox hardwired to ethernet, my Pc on Wifi in the next room, my Chromebook, and my phone is also on wifi when I'm home. And I also have an old Samsung tablet I barely ever use. However probably only one of these devices would ever be in use at one time since I'm single and live alone.

So what's the bottleneck? And is there any setting I could change on my router to help?

249,"Hey everyone!
So i came a cross a very strange problem the other day regarding my internet connection, which I managed to solve in a rather unexpected way and I'm wondering if anybody can explain exactly what went on.
I built my first system about 2 months ago (with your help, thanks for that btw) and it worked really well but it made me realise my 12 mbps download/ 1mbps upload speed was the real bottleneck to my experience. So I upgraded my connection to a fiber connection of 100/10.
 After the installation (new cables in the house, new router and all) I tested the internet speed on my pc (ethernet connection) using both Ookla speedtest and google speedtest and they seemed to be close to the pre-upgrade values, maybe even a little bit worse on the uploads! I tested on my phone and laptop (5ghz wifi) and they were 99/9.9 , nearly exactly as advertised by the provider. Naturally I blamed the ethernet cable and tried using a different one but the result was the same. I also tried using both ethernet cables on the laptop and they both worked flawlessly, providing the advertised speeds!
Troubleshooting steps I took included:
â€¢Trying all ethernet ports on the router
â€¢Resetting both the router and the pc multiple times
â€¢Connecting via wifi using included mobo antenna
â€¢Reinstalling wifi/lan drivers
â€¢Disabling some obscure windows settings
â€¢Messing with pretty much every network setting
After every change I made I tested the network speed and it always seemed to improve by just a tiny bit, without ever getting close to the expected values. I gave up and fell asleep, secretly hoping it would somehow fix itself if I give it a few hours. When I woke up it was the same.
Now here comes the weird part; the actual fix:
I noticed how every change I made slightly increased my speed and in a moment of desperation, I just started repeatedly doing speedtests. Without changing anything, the internet speed kept creeping up like before. Thing is, it was increasing at a near exponential rate! After 20 minutes of continuous speedtests, the internet speed was up to the advertised speeds and it remains so until now; about a month later! I still dont know what the problem was. I will provide a (relevant) hardware list down below.

Mobo: ASRock x570 Taichi (with gigabit lan)

The reason why i upgraded was due to my home office moving to a remote spot in my house where i cant get a network cable too (unless i wanna run one along the floor).

&#x200B;

Anyways, i am now getting very inconsistent download speeds over wifi even with full bars of strength. My internet is supposed to be 45 down and 5 up. Every other device in my house whether it be xbox or my phone gets those speeds no problem. But for some reason on my desktop im only getting about 25mbps. My adapter is a TP-Link tl-wn881nd V1. It doesn't have a proper windows 10 driver from TP link but Qualcomm has its own windows 10 driver for it which works. And when i run a speed test its like its literally hitting a wall and cant go past 23-25mbps. And when i try to download something or even download a popular torrent like Ubuntu, it STILL wont go past 23-25 despite a few hours ago of me testing the speeds and everything (doing the exact same tests i am now) and it being fine then.

&#x200B;

Now here is the odd thing. When i FIRST installed the card, it was working fine. Getting perfect download speeds with no issues. I come back to the computer 2 hours later and now its literally cut in half.

I turn off every device in the house but the computer, still the same slow speeds. I check wifi analyzer and i have zero congestion on channel 1. My Wifi adapter in the computer says im connected at 144.4mbps, despite the signal strength being excellent and the card supporting 300mbps.

I've disabled my antivirus, rebooted multiple times, and i've even tried older versions of the qualcomm driver for this wifi card yet i cannot explain why im not getting almost half the speed that i should be despite it working literally hours ago and i changed absolutely nothing......

&#x200B;

I also tried doing a dns flush, netsh winsock reset, etc..etc.. And to make sure it wasn't something wierd going on, i temporarily ran a network cable to my computer, ran a speed test and boom, no problem's what so ever with getting 45 down. So this is  literally just a wifi problem.

&#x200B;

Im at a complete loss here. Can anyone provide some feedback or something to try that i might be missing?

Since I work from home, my thoughts are to downgrade but keep the Frontier connection as a fallback (and possibly use it for cloud backups because even the slowest one is on-par with Comcast for uploads).

I knew my Edgerouter POE wouldn't be sufficient (although in speedtests I can almost hit theoretical max), so I need to upgrade.

My plan was to use a VM on my R510 but that's actually even worse, capping out around 550 Mbps.

Looking at options, I have a (but haven't tested) a PC with a Core i7-3770k and another pc with a Core i3-4330 - I suspect both would readily outperform the R510 with dual E5640's.

Now I should probably test this theory before actually buying hardware, but if I were to buy hardware, it seems my options are:

* Edgerouter ER-6P. I'm familiar with the EdgeMAX routers so that's good. 6 ports should allow LAG to the cable modem + switch + connection to the backup (which might or might not be pointless - but overprovisioning.. :-)
* Alternatively, forget about the LACP and just go for the Edgerouter 4.
* Some kind of MikroTik router? I'm unfamiliar with their offerings.

Well I did set up this:

Fiber -> ONT -> EdgeRouter X -> PowerLine (Devolo 550 duo+) -> Electric Wiring -> PowerLine (same type as the other) -> PC.

I expected to have less speed due the powerline connection but I'm getting a weird behaviour.

When I test my speed (to internet) on the computer using speedtest.net I get my actual max speed (50 Mbps). That's alright.

But when I check ""fast.com"" I get always 11~10 Mbps..... but If I move the computer to the router  and connect it to it (I also tried it connecting it to the Powerline of the router side too, since it acts as a switch with the two connections it has) I always get 50 Mbps.

If I download from a remote Server I have, I get 11~10 MBps when connected trought the electric wiring, and 50 Mbps when connected directly to the router or the powerline connected to the router.

So far it seems the issue is simply that I'm losing speed in the electric wire.... and that speedtest is reporting the wrong speed.

But then when downloading games from Steam I always get the full connection 50 Mbps :S even when using the powerline connection.

So clearly is something wrong with the powerline connection but I'm clueless why some things download at max speed even when using the powerline but others always go slow (but fast when connected directly to the router).

I did test it with an other laptop and same behaviour, (one Laptop on Linux, and the other on windows).
Additional info:

My latency is around 15~20 to google.com, fast.com and speedtest.net (using the powerline connection)

Excuse me for my novice being a brand new customer and user to a NAS device. I have setup my NAS properly connected to my internet device router with an ethernet cable.

I setup a raid 5 and followed all the detailed information from tutorials and research.

I connected to the network from my macbook pro retina running Catalina (10.15.7) and then I used black magic speed test to see how the connection speed was and it was less than 4mbps read and write.

My internet speed is around 90-150mbps download and upload normally.

Then I tried to connect directly using USB cable from laptop to NAS and it does not work that way form what I have read.

How am I suppose to transfer my data of 10-12TB onto this loud NAS device? over the network?

I bought this to use as my master work drive for editing photos and video and for creating an archive I can access files on the go. But if there is no way to connect with a very fast read and write speed (like better than normal HD) then i'm unable to use this.",not related,Not related,,test results,slow internet,troubleshooting,,

301,"I have a HP laptop with an A10-4655 6GB Memory, Windows 8.1 64 bit that has a 100 Mbps on board network ethernet.  When I run speedtest I get around 62.8Mbps.  I have a USB 3 to Gigabit adapter but still only get 78Mbps when I use that on the same computer.

When I use the same cable on another computer with a Gigabit I get 170Mbps, so the speed is coming into the house, the routers are Gigabit, all good except on the HP laptop.  Another Dell Laptop with Gigabit, also gets 170Mpbs. 

Anything I should check on the HP to boost speeds?  The HP is Windows 8.1, other machines are Windows 7, all 64 bit Professional which might not even be a concern.  All the other machines are Dells, and their business grade machines, although older.  The HP is a consumer machine I bought new and cheap at one of the big box office stores, so it might not be as beefy component wise, but didn't think networking would be a costly component thing. 

As far as the LAN, what kind of speed should you get going with a 100 Mbps?  I assume there is some overhead and such, but say from SSD to SSD over the network just to eliminate hard drive speed, and all are SATA III, and all going on when nobody else is using the LAN to eliminate that variable.

I'm just trying to use all the bandwidth I have to move files, or to download.  Since I have a 150Mbps connection (provider is trying to convince me to upgrade to 300, and they are making sure I am actually getting the promised 150Mbps so I'll upgrade).

Any thoughts on the bottleneck when I use the Gigabit Adapter?  Are speeds in the 60Mbps range normal for a 100Mbps on board adapter on a notebook?  Naturally 80Mbps is slow for a Gigabit adapter, but does USB 3.0 slow it down, or could the notebook be sharing some interrupts that are slowing things down?

313,"Back story: My brother has been paying for our Qwest/CenturyLink DSL internet for 10 years, which is when we moved into a condo together here in Colorado. Other than occasional (sometimes almost regular) internet outages, it's been fine for the most part, albeit rather slow at 7Mbps. I replaced our old Qwest-branded modem and the connection cables about 2 years ago with a newer, CenturyLink-branded Actiontec C1000A modem and cables, and since my brother authorized me as a user on his account, I was able to get on the phone with tech support to help me configure that new modem with the existing connection. All was well.

Well, my brother moved out of state about 5 years ago and I figured it's time for me to finally stop having him paying for internet he only uses the 6-7 times a year he visits, so I talked to him about it and he said for me to cancel his internet service and start up my own. Fair enough.

So I called CL on July 16th and stated that I was a new customer looking to pay for internet service, and I was very clear that we already have internet service at the address, but that I was going to start up my own internet account, and that I would cancel my brother's service once it was established that mine was working. I asked the CL agent on the phone if that arrangement was possible, even explicitly asking how that would work, since I was going to start paying for 40Mbps and my brother's account is 7Mbps. ""Would the higher speed just cancel out the lower speed since it's all installed on the same line?"", I asked. The agent said that the internet service would continue at the address, but simply reflect the higher speed and that it was just a simple flip of a switch. I also told her that I already have a working modem, and she even verified that the Actiontec C100A is a CL-compatible modem, but that CL would still send me a modem because she didn't have an option in her form to not send new customer a modem, and that I would have to ""catch"" the technician trying to deliver me a modem in order to refuse it without having to officially return it. (CL should really have an option for people who already have modems to not be sent one automatically, only to have to go through the trouble of returning it at a UPS store.) Anyways, the agent gave me a CL account number of 303-XXX-XXXX and set an activation date of July 19th.

I work as a web developer, so I arranged to work from home that day and anxiously awaited for the newer speed to activate. I kept doing speedtests that day, but it was still only around 5-6Mbps by late afternoon. I call CL around 5pm and ask what's going on....the agent had trouble finding my account information using the 303 number I was set up with. Furthermore, she couldn't pull up my account looking up the order number and customer code I had jotted down as well, but finally found me through searching my name through the system. Agent said the order for a new internet activation was placed into ""held orders"", since there's already an existing internet line installed and it's likely a technician never even came to the area that day. (That would've been nice to know, CL! Why didn't anyone let me know that beforehand? Why did I have to call to find that out?) Agent says I'd have to install a second phone jack to install a new line at the location, which doesn't make sense to me as we only need one internet line at the address, so I push back on that and ask if I can just have my brother's account cancelled and mine activated; again, no need to install another physical jack inside the residence. I also ask why this whole ""existing internet"" problem wasn't brought up by the agent I spoke to on July 16th when I mentioned this whole situation, but all I got was a quick apology and a mumbling about how the first agent should've recognized that would've been a problem. Agent sets me up with a new account number, 720-XXX-XXXX, new order number, new customer code, and sets me up with a NEW activation date, July 24th, and then immediately forwards me to the cancellation department to cancel my brother's account effective July 24th as well, in an effort to coordinate having my brother's service cancelled and my service activated in one fell swoop. Cancellation goes without a hitch.

The next day, on July 20th, I receive a modem on my front door. I call CL; turns out it was mailed automatically by the system. Ugh. So I use the included return label inside the package and return it to a UPS store.

The next day, July 21st, I figured I'd call CL to verify what's going on with me having two accounts. (Not including my brother's account, of course, but the two accounts started under my name - the initial 303 one, and the 720 one I was later set up with). The agent was able to look up both accounts right away, and said the system showed my 303 account was ""active"" and service started on July 19th. (Uh, no it didn't!) Agent said I'd have to cancel the 303 account myself. I said ""I didn't create this situation; why should I have to cancel it? Shouldn't an agent cancel it?"" Agent said they couldn't, and that if I didn't, I'd start getting billed for services on two accounts. At this point, part of me wanted to refuse cancelling one of the accounts and just hound the billing department come invoice time month after month telling them about CL's mistake of setting me up with two accounts and make THEM deal with it, but it would've been a headache for me to fight that battle month after month, so reluctantly I agreed to be forwarded to cancellation to cancel the 303 account. Cancellation goes without a hitch.

I call back again and explain this whole thing, this time my point being that I don't want them to automatically send ANOTHER modem, since the modem I received was under the first 303 account, and that I was afraid I'd be sent a modem under the 720 account. Agent said she'd put a note to not send a modem, as I already have one.

July 24th comes, and because I'm very busy at work I don't get home until evening, and of course there's another. FREAKING. MODEM. On the doorstep - this time under the new 720 account. I again open it up, slap on the return label, tape it back up, and return it to the same UPS store probably looking like a maniac in the store with the enraged face I had. I return back home, and I discover there's no internet at the house. ""Fine,"" I figured, ""the modem probably just needs to be configured for the new connection."" I unplug my modem, unplug the dsl line from the phone jack in the wall, and go to sleep as it was getting late.

Coming home from work the next day on July 25th, I call CL just to confirm that the order is completed and hooked up, and that all that's left for me to do is to configure the modem. Agent said ""yup, order's completed, let me transfer you to tech support to configure the modem."" I plug my modem back in, connect the dsl line back up to the phone jack, and follow the instructions with tech support. After 2 1/2 hours of following the tech support's instructions of hard-resetting the modem, power cycling the modem, quadruple-checking that I have the correct PPP username and PPP Password to connect the modem to the internet, double-checking all the connections, restoring the modem itself to factory settings to wipe out any possibility of the modem hanging onto my brother's old account info, and pushing back on the tech's suggestion that there's something wrong with my modem and that I need to ""get a new one"" (ridiculous, it was working last week under my brother's account), the tech support agent FINALLY concedes that there must be something wrong with the install, and that a technician's going to have to come out today and check the line and also my modem inside the residence.

Is this the kind of experience a new customer is supposed to have? This is ridiculous. Why don't the techs follow up with the customer to see if the line was indeed installed correctly, and results in a successful modem connection? Or better yet, have the tech come inside the place the first go-around and actually configure the modem themselves, to make sure the install is complete before taking off? It's not an unreasonable request, especially since CL asks people ahead of time what make/model modem they have to check for compatibility. I actually had frustrating experience with CL back in June when it was still my brother's account, when my wife and I came back from vacation and realized we had no internet, and after calling tech support, they sent out a technician, who when he came out, said that another CL technician a week before that had accidentally disconnected our internet service when working out on the box, doing service for some other person's line. What's going on with your technicians, CL?

Edit: Update: Finally got internet working last night on Wednesday, two days after the activation date. The techinican had to come inside the house, confirmed that it wasn't my modem that was the problem, it was the circuitry at the box that needed to be updated from my brother's old ADSL setup to my new VDSL setup. Why the tech that came to the box on Monday didn't recognize this or check with me to see if his activation by the box actually had me connected to the internet, I don't know. The tech did mention that the contractors that CenturyLink sometimes hires for these things don't really do their job thoroughly.

It may that your modem is connecting to the exchange at a rock solid 40Mb/s however your connection is only ever as good as the slowest part of the path to and from the destination.

If there is a problem with the exchange connecting to the wider Internet then that might explain the disparity between the various speed tests. However, someone more knowledgeable will likely point out how I'm wrong.

**Surfshark**

PROS

- inexpensive and works well. i paid $74 after taxes for 36 months. has worked with all streaming services outside the country with no problems. works on all devices ive tried it on (mac, iphone, ipad, firestick)
- unlimited devices
- no DNS leaks, only shows up on 1 DNS server
- highest vpn speed out of all 3 (400Mbs over wifi on 1Gb connection)
- easy to use, straightforward
- customer support has honestly tried to help me with the main issue ive had (first con) and usually replies within a couple of hours.
- speaking of CS, i like that the have the chat in the app
- outside 14 eyes

CONS

- the biggest thing i haven't liked is torrenting support. using qBittorrent on mac. while i didnt have any DNS leaks and my real public IP was masked, when i did the torrent detection test, my real IP would show up every single time. they told me to change proxies, security type, use their ""dedicated torrent servers"" that never showed up in my list of servers. today i switched to Transmission and it passed the test of showing the same IP as the VPN server. i wish it would work with qBittorrent like the other 2 do.
- when using a gen 2 amazon firestick with 10/100/1000 ethernet port (microUSB can only transfer up to 450Mbs), using their most popular protocols (IKEv2, OpenVPN UDP/TCP) got me only 8Mbs on speedtests which wouldnt work to stream smoothly. they advised me to use the Shadowsocks protocol, which is a proxy. when speedtest ran, i got up to 50Mbs. i realize this is not the fault of the vpn, it's most likely the hardware. but i would rather use the more secure protocols.
- too good to be true? 3 years for the same price as 1 year of TorGuard (with 50% discount applied)? ive seen recommendations to only get paid vpn services from a provider for 6 months or 1 year. the service might change/get worse, they might get breached/audited/not protect your data like they said they would, etc. also, since it is a newer vpn, their servers might not be overcrowded now, but could be in the future as more people start to use them.
- sometimes when i connect to my nearest server, it shows the location to be near my location, but the IP address will be from a totally different state. idk what that's about...
- most people dont have amazing things to say about the service. it usually is rated below average and have complaints of keeping data for ""informational purposes."" their T&C are vague and unclear at times.


**ExpressVPN**

PROS

- well known, good reputation, frequently recommended

- 2nd fastest speed (300Mbs over wifi with 1Gb internet)

- easy to use. phone app is to the point with a few nice options and tools (password generator, DNS leak test, etc). desktop app simple to use as well.

- torrents work well and prevent torrenting detection

- outside 14 eyes


CONS

- most expensive service

- least number of devices permitted (five) out of the 3.

- has had some security issues in the past and they have been blocked from Netflix/Hulu when the host bans their vpn IP address

- they log information about how much data you transfer each day, date connected, and to what server connected to.

**TorGuard** ^(with streaming service)

PROS

- rated higher than the other 2 vpns, lots of good reviews

- 2 dedicated IP addresses that guarantee that you will have streaming access to Netflix

- 8 devices allowed

- LOTS of customization options! very configurable. 1000x more options than the other 2 vpns offer.

- tech support has been great. they usually get back with me in under an hour, sometimes its within minutes

- more security protocol and proxy options offered

- although short, their data collection policy simply states ""torguard does not collect or log any data from its VPN or proxy services""....short and sweet

CONS

- BIGGEST downside for me is the speed. while i was getting 300-400Mbs with the other 2 services, i only could get THIRTY Mbs download from torguard. i am going to contact them to see if there are things that can be adjusted to get decent speeds comparable to the others. i really wanted to keep this service over the others, but if it only can get this speed, no way am i keeping it.

- another BIG thing i didnt like was that you have to put ALL of your billing information when signing up. in their security policy, they say this is for ""standard business operations"" and to prevent fraud and abuse. they also store name, address, date/time when you sign up. silver lining is that you can request them to remove all personal information by sending them an email.

- only 7 day refund window after paying. other 2 have 30 day windows.

- based inside USA (five eyes), can be forced to hand over data if ordered.

- mobile app is different than all the others, and not in a good way. it might just be personal, but i liked it the least out of them all.

- EDIT: I found out after I cancelled their service that if you register the 2 dedicated IPs, they are non-refundable, something to keep in mind.

So those are my observations after using these vpns for a little bit. If you got this far, thanks for reading. I appreciate any advice that can be given, especially firsthand experiences with them.","comparisons, slow internet",Not related ,,not related,,,,

She works from home (we live in a new apartment that was built last year) and needs to teach remotely using Zoom. When she is sharing her screen and teaching it freezes for like 30 seconds, then comes back and does that several times through out the session. We have literally tried everything to figure out what it is. Some troubleshooting for your information:

1. I use zoom on my laptop and share my screen I do not have this issue.
2. She used a different computer from the hospital and tried it, but still had the same issue.
3. We got a new modem, but still had the same issue.
4. She tried teaching at different locations like her parents house or onsite at the hospital and both of those locations had ***no issues***, Zoom was working perfectly fine.
5. It is not the internet connection at our apartment because she hardwired using an Ethernet cable and still had the same issue. We preformed an internet speed test and all of the speeds were high.

We are thinking it has to do with the VPN, since she works for a hospital the security is super high...so maybe Zoom is having trouble communicating with the internet of our apartment plus the VPN security firewall is getting clogged up? I have no idea. She thinks it is the apartment itself, but then why does my Zoom have no issues? If it was the apartment layout/tech wouldn't it be affecting me as well? Btw all other video applications work for her no problem as well. Microsoft Teams works perfectly fine and does not have the same issue. This issue has been going on for months now and we are stuck.

481,"speed test is irrelevant via ps4 (as stated on the test). Most gaming communication uses UDP due to speed requirements (ultra low latency for real time use like voice chat and first person shooters etc). that delivers your game instructions/moves etc to the game server. internet sites like google/yahoo useTCP that can make pages still load correctly even with small loss (in this case the pipe is full from time to time while connecting to your game, your game assumes that the game server got your moved/instructions) but it may not. When you see a lagged person bouncing around the screen in  the game this is because part of the instructions are missing that give the fluid movement to the character. After too many missed messages that person likely will get disconnected but not all application developers (the people who make the game) understand how realtime networks work.

Think of your internet connection you share with your city/town as a huge water pipe. From time to time the pipe only has so much space for data(water) to pass through it. TCP sends data to the internet with the intent of making sure whatever you tried to do actually go to the website like say logging in. If TCP doesn't get a response to you trying to login to say gmail in an appropriate amount of time it retries to login again. This is all subsecond and you're oblivious to this. UDP(what gaming servers use) has no mechanism for loss correction.

With the record number of people working from home and people coming home from college etc. Im willing to bet your provider in you area may be overloaded. The game provider also has a pipe to the internet could also be overloaded as well. That said, I do believe some of the servers that host these games (in AWS) are likely being overrun due to increased use as college/schools are done for this season. Ive seen increased latency and ping issues connecting to battlefield 5 servers, so in short this is likely seasonal and hopefully your provider will increase the internet pipe before then so you'll have less issues.","advice, gaming","Not related? advice, ",,gaming,advice,explanation,,

I am questioning if maybe there is something wrong with my bitmonero data.mdb file, or if this is a common issue.

I have Cake Wallet on my phone, which syncs 1,000 blocks in about 10 seconds.

This means sometimes your hardware may not support the full speeds.

Ensure your wired ethernet adapter can support gigabit speeds. Ensure it's driver is up to date.

If you're using a USB ethernet, you'll see a loss.

If you're using wifi or router you may see loss in overhead or interference/distance.

Test with another device.

Test direct connection.

472,"Ok I have NO idea what is going on, but I need help.

I have an issue with my connection to google and other services where they will never connect unless I have a VPN enabled (I use Nord connected to New York). The issue is I frequently have an issue where my upload speed drops to 0.05 mbps, and the only way I have found to fix it is to restart my pc. Normally I'd blame the VPN for the speed issues, but there's no way for me to see if that is the case because I can't load a speedtest without it enabled.

This issue only started about 8 months ago. I disabled the windows firewall and the problem went away for a couple of days and then returned (I also tried reenabling the firewall after this, but that gave me error codes even with a VPN on). I was on an old CPU and motherboard, and when I upgraded my stuff, the issue went away for about a week only to come back again. I didn't do a clean install of Windows when I upgraded my parts, so maybe that will help? (I know literally nothing about internet/software, so I'm completely lost.)

Another minor annoyance, when I connect to anywhere with Nord, Google starts putting login pages in other languages as it thinks I'm in another country. I've seen anywhere from the UK to Pakistan, and I'm over getting search results of Arabic sites when I google something.

333,"First, how I got in to this mess.  I'm with Shaw for internet, have a Hitron CGNM-2250 for a modem/router that's usually in bridge mode.  I've always used my own router/ap setup which consists of an Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X and an AP-AC-LR respectively.  This morning I was troubleshooting some slow internet speeds and inconsistent speedtest results so I decided to upgrade the firmware on my router since it was long out of date.  I completed the firmware upgrade and the router somehow bricked itself.  Did some searching and found it's possible to try and recover it using a USB-TTL device and some header on the board of the ER-X but the cable doesn't get here til Wed, and I need a router in the meantime.

&#x200B;

Here's the problem:  I asked Shaw to unbridge my modem so I can use the wifi/switch on it in the interim, but a strange issue has cropped up.  I have a Win7 box that just runs as a file/emby server and although it will connect just fine to the internet (i have a kb and monitor on it right now) I can't ping it, or see it from any other device on my network, I have tried both wireless and wired on the Win7 box, and on my laptop.  I have a macbook pro and my android phone, neither can ping it, even though it's currently connected and can browse the internet just fine.  I could connect to shares on this machine just fine before, and did so as recently as last night.  The only real difference between the two networks is my ER-X is configured with a 10.0.0.0 IP and the Hitron is a 192.168.0.0.  I'm not looking to answer questions as to why I'm using that IP range on my ER-X, I just do, and it's worked fine.

&#x200B;

Right now the Win7 box is using DHCP for both wired and wireless and I can't ping either adapter from any machine.  Nothing in the Windows firewall was changed.  Any thoughts are welcomed.

&#x200B;

I'm actually trying to get another OS to run off of a USB stick just for testing purposes, but I'm assuming it has something to do with this Windows install.  I've never seen anything like this, and I've been doing computer stuff for a long time.

&#x200B;

tl;dr changed routers and can't ping/see any interface on a Win7 box.  Everything is DHCP.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  got ping working by adding a firewall rule to specifically allow it, but I don't ever remember having to do this to be able to ping this or any other windows machine.  I can now ping the interface, but still can't browse to it or see any of the shares from my mac.",not related,Not related,,not related,,,,

781,"In my experience testing it for the last months the external monitor/TV experience is *extremely* rough. Luckily many of the issues I had before seem to be fixed in the last month or so, so that provides hope to Steam fixing most of these issues before shipping the Dock.

When you've plugged in a 4k monitor, you need to do a little dance in order to set >30Hz refreshrates. For me this helps:

1. Go to Desktop Mode
2. Attach display through USB-C
3. Go to settings
4. Set resolution on external display to 1080p
5. Save and apply
6. Close settings app (important, this reloads the display settings part of it somehow)
7. Re-open settings app
8. Now I'm able to set 1080p 120Hz, 4k 60Hz, etc

Some of the issues I've encountered with external displays:

* No ability to set resolution or refreshrate for external displays in Gaming Mode
* 4k 120Hz external displays default to 4k 30Hz with no option to change this in Gaming Mode
* Gaming Mode animation speed seems tied to the refreshrate/framerate. This causes all animations to be crawlingly slow on 4k 30Hz default for external displays and makes the Gaming Mode UI a pain to navigate
* Steam overlay fails to show properly on 4k external display after switching to Desktop Mode and back to Gaming Mode
* QuickSettings overlay fails to show properly on 4k external display after switching to Desktop Mode and back to Gaming Mode
* After: \[setting external display to 1080P 120Hz in Desktop Mode, switching to Gaming Mode, disconnecting external display\], the gamescope framerate limit is stuck at 120FPS/120Hz instead of 60Hz/60FPS in Gaming Mode causing the UI animations to be too fast and causing missed frames as the internal display only runs 60Hz
* In Desktop Mode only 4k up to 30Hz shows up in the menu. After \[switchting to 1080p, applying, closing the settings app, reopening the settings app\] I'm able to select 1080p 120Hz and 4k 60Hz (highest my USB-C adapter goes)

They included their own WiFi extender to boost signal to the doorbell, but the outdoor camera rarely works and seems to be down more than its up.

Later I tried connecting to a Minecraft server. I was able to connect but there was an incredible amount of lag; my client would take several seconds to sync up the server, only to lag out for another 5-10 seconds. After a few minutes I would be disconnected. In some cases I would just be falling through the world for about 30 seconds before getting disconnected. There were plenty of other users online and they confirmed in discord that the issue was on my end only. Nobody else had any problems.

I checked speedtest.net and my speed was 350 down 100 up with a ping of about 10ms, so no issue there. Pinging and tracert on the server's ip showed no issues either. I restarted my computer, restarted my router, even had my ISP restart the ONT. No improvement whatsoever.

Later I was playing Valorant with my wife and we both had a ""network connection issue"" in the corner of the screen. On random rounds controls would stop working for one or both of us; we could move our character around but it would not let us jump, shoot, use abilities, or otherwise interact with the game itself. After the round ended things would sometimes be fine until a few rounds later. This was happening on two separate computers on multiple days which makes me think it's a network issue.

The most bizarre thing I noticed was when I was trying to get a video to record the issue. When the issue came up in Valorant I pressed Alt+Z to bring up the NVidia overlay and turned the instant replay feature on so I could get a video. My computer froze for about half a second then the controls were working again. A few rounds later the same problems came up, after turning instant replay off then back on the computer froze again for a moment then it was fixed again.

What is going on here? I'm seeing multiple problems across multiple applications on multiple devices. I would assume it's a network problem, but my ISP can't identify any issues. And for some reason NVidia is able to temporarily resolve the issue, at least for a few minutes at a time.

Any help is appreciated, I have zero idea what's going on here. The fact that it isn't isolated to one application nor one computer would seem to point to some network issue, but the fact that turning on a separate software feature temporarily fixes it doesn't make sense if it's network related.

347,"1) My understanding of how proxies and firewalls work is rudimentary, as is my understanding of ports.

2) Internet was slow, so I did a speedtest, and the server it connected to was very far away, so I clicked and it said that a firewall or proxy server had blocked port 8080, limiting the servers it could connect to. The result was a very slow connection, for everyone and every device connected to my router, which makes me think itâ€™s router-related?

The question is not how to fix it, (it seemed to unblock by itself 15ish minutes later) but rather why it happened in the first place? Iâ€™m just very curious. The only variable that changed on my end (that I know of) is having two family members over who were also using the internet.

I've had Windows Server 2016 set up on my R610 for quite a while now with Hyper-V serving all my VM's including pfSense.  I have a gigabit internet connection and never really thought much about speed until today when I happened to notice that copies from my NAS (a separate whitebox) were much faster to my desktop than to my 610. 

A few hours of testing later and I seem to have found the issue.  On my desktop I can consistently get 900/900 on speedtest.net.  On both the existing setup and a fresh install of sever 2016 on the R610, it's much more sporadic.  Usually it's around 500/700 but it varies and can sometimes dip below 100.  I also tried the drivers from Dell's website to no avail.  If I boot a livecd of linux on the R610, 900/900 no issues.  Speedtest.net is not exactly the most foolproof method but it's consistent here and I didn't have many other options.

I know Server 2016 is not officially on the R610 supported list, but this is homelab and ""not supported"" doesn't faze us often.  Does anyone have any ideas before I resign myself to migrating to ESXi?

They were showing speeds between 350-400 Mbps (download) and 25-30 Mbps (upload).

Our iPhones were consistently hitting 700 Mbps (iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro), but our iPad Pros (4th Gen, 5th Gen with M1) were getting the slower speeds. All of these speeds were done over WiFi.

Since I just got it set up the way I want it, I was hesitant to do that right off the bat. After removing a Firewall app from my system, my MacBook Pro is now hitting 700 Mbps+. The iPads are still running slower than they should be though. Has anyone else run into issues like this?

Our house is approximately 1500 square feet so we are never more than 10-15 feet away from an access point and at one point we ran a speed test on the iPhone 12 Pro and MacBook Air when they were sitting directly next to the Router. We also verified from the network map that they were both connected wirelessly to the Router and not one of the satellites.

Any advice or insights would be appreciated.

.... -0 to -68 is your range.  Low signal would be -30 to -68

NOTE: Unfortunately the number listed does include a negative but for all purposes ignore the -  ... You want a lower number.  I would agree the negative - is confusing.. I tried to say lower meaning a smaller number.  If I tried to throw something in there like greater than the negative it could also confuse some people who are not used to dealing with negative numbers.   I guess it's how you view it.

* Merged ssid and bandwidth steering has known issues with multiple vendors. Why deal with bandwidth steering problems when you can simply setup another ssid. There are many devices that bandwidth steer to 2.4ghz when they could be running on 5ghz at a higher throughput. I'm not sure why you think it is so hard to setup another SSID and have control over your wifi network?
* Sure, you can let the router decide what channels to pick but once you step into 80mhz territory you want to control what zones have dfs vs non-dfs. Letting your router pick channels can cause issues since it may choose a dfs range.  Then that range may fail and it may choose another DFS range that fails.. causing your client to flip between channels often. Those small changes can introduce latency while gaming. Why deal with that if you take the time and setup a solid channel plan.
* Turning down power is not bad advice when you have mobile devices that have weak power or poor antenna design.  You really think your mobile phone or chromecast has the same output as a high end router? If you want, go ahead and turn up your power, but your devices at the farthest distance will have lower throughput. This sucks if you have something like a wifi camera streaming data back up to the cloud.  Tell me how that works for you..

-More access points are only required if you do not have the signal strength.  If you live in an open floor plan with no walls, maybe a warehouse, sure maybe a single AP will cover a larger area.  Once you start adding walls and doors the game changes.  Signal strength is what determines the amount of coverage/APs you require.  This is the physics of wireless signals. The further and weaker the signal the poorer your WIFI is.

-Mesh products are using a set channel range to connect to the other APs.  Whenever possible you want to run cables between APs for best performance.

##More APs isn't the answer. That is the literal point of nearly every mesh product on the market, and they can make far more informed decisions with all the RSSI data, client capabilities etc etc.##
When you talk about ""every mesh product"" I guess you're really talking about adding additional APs, because this is what they are.  As I mentioned in my post I'm not 100% up on mesh APs but I would assume (assume is the key word here) that you still have control over your wireless plan (meaning what channels to use ) on those mesh APs where they are located. If you want to educate the community on different wireless mesh APs and how they work I say go for it.  But as I mentioned I really didn't get into mesh'd wireless APs.

##mixed disinformation. I've never seen a single ISP prioritize speedtest traffic. Having a speedtest in their network is reasonable, but with speedtest.net you can easily pick an off network server.##
And those other networks give priority to incoming tests as well. They wouldn't want to look like they have issues within their own network if you're looking to switch providers.

354,"I have been suffering from some terrible LAN speeds over ethernet.

My local network is theoretically capable of 1gbps but I've recently been running tests with IPerf3 and found my LAN speeds to be as slow as ~9mbps. Additionally, running tests on speedtest.com, I get ~8.5mbps download with my wired connection but ~445mbps down via wifi on my phone (445mbps is well above what I'm paying my ISP for). This terrible WAN download speed result is even after terminating NordVPN. My cellphone is typically not connected to NordVPN.

The first time the slowdown happened I rebooted all of my network devices (modem, router, switch) and I was once again back to full speed (~995mbps LAN and ~450mbps WAN) but everything slowed down again less than 12 hours later. After a few more days of rebooting my entire network every time it slowed down I found that power cycling just the switch was enough to restore my network speeds. This tells me that the issue was never with my router or modem but purely with the switch (additionally evidenced by my uninterrupted high-speed service over wifi).

After consulting my friend who is a network admin as well as Reddit's /r/techsupport forum the consensus seemed to be that my unmanaged switch was a dud. I then upgraded to a ""managed"" model (TP-Link TL-SG108E) and I am finding that this exact same slowdown cycle is still occuring. However, now that I have a managed switch I can access it via a GUI on my desktop and voila! with NordVPN open on my computer I receive an error called ""Socket Bind Port Error."" This prevents me from accessing the switch's management interface until I terminate NordVPN (and the NordLynx adapter disappears from my control panel). This entire process has led me to the conclusion that NordVPN's network adapter settings are confusing the shit out of my hardware switches (both managed and unmanaged models) and completely nuking my wired internet speeds.

Hello,

I have Xfinity Internet (Blast! Pro, up to 400Mbps plan). We moved into this home two years ago, switching from AT&T to Xfinity. I bought a Netgear CM1000 and Comcast came out to install it since the wiring to the house was outdated. Everything worked fine. Then last year, the line to the house was cut in our backyard, and a technician came out to re-run a new line to the house. Everything was working well again, and we had maybe one drop a month. Speed tests were ranging from 375 Mbps to 425 Mbps. The router is the Google mesh style, AC1200.

Starting last week, we started getting a few drops a day. This morning, the modem cannot maintain a connection for more than 30-45 minutes. Now, speed tests (at the router) are struggling to get over 90 Mbps.

I've attached a screenshot of the logs and upstream/downstream power and SNR.

I've confirmed that the modem is plugged directly into the RG6 wall jack, using the tech-supplied coax cable. There are no splitters (AFAIK), as the wall jack leads to the attic, and then to the side of the house. No other RG6 devices in the house.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions!

Make sure that hardware acceleration is working on the router.  Try turning off QOS (quality of service).  Search for gigabit speeds on snbforums for a list of settings to change.

Consider installing AsusMerlin firmware.  It has pluses and minuses with your router.

The copy speeds were slow when I started, but have degraded to so slow that I won't finish uploading files before my holiday break is over, which is why I need some help.

So far I have learned that the device is basically unusable whenever the file indexing or moments face recognition tasks are running. By unusable, I mean, sometimes it's unreachable over the network, sometimes the virtual remote desktop will stop working, or if I am remoted in, sometimes tasks will stop responding, even file station will show a blank window, sometimes for minutes, sometimes permanently. I've started pausing those tasks when I start a file copy task (over network or USB) so the files can copy at a reasonable speed (slow, but fast enough to finish overnight) and then I can choose to start the indexing at a more convenient time. What's never made sense to me is the resource monitor widget never shows the CPU or memory as more than 50% utilized, usually far less, so I don't understand why everything else slows to a stop.

Today I discovered the more detailed resource monitor hoping to diagnose these performance issues and with indexing and moments/face recognition paused I'm seeing 100% volume utilization while other resources are 50% or less. Looking at the process monitor before restarting I saw MANY facial recognition tasks still running with supposedly 125MB of ram for each (I only have 512MB total) but after restarting I see none of those tasks, yet the hard drive still sounds busy as ever.

I opened Minecraft and everything is SUUPER laggy. When I hold tab it shows I have 1 bar of connection to the server. I've never ever had this issue before.

10,"There are a great many reasons why this could happen but one thing to ask is how are you and your girlfriend connecting to the internet?  Is it over wireless or a wired connection?  Do you use the same kind of connection?

If you're using wireless, try unplugging your router for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in.  Memory leaks happen in routers and can cause a variety of issues which is why it's not a bad idea to hard-boot it from time to time when you are experiencing possible connection issues.

If you've already tried this or the problem persists, try testing your speed at [speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/).  It'll show you your Ping, Down and Up speeds.  Compare your results to hers.  Is there a big difference  between the two?",,,,advice,,,,

About issue see my previous post: How do I stop constant connection drops in NordVPN for Windows

For example in BiglyBT, bind local IP-address to right NIC for example eth04 (NordLynx Tunnel #2) 10.5.0.2NordLynx Tunnel

Try next in NordLynx (adapter properties) properties (in Windows): 
Client for Microsoft-networks = disable it 
File- and printer sharing for Microsoft-networks = disable it 
Microsoft-protocol for networkadapter-multiplexor = disable it 
Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6) = disable it 
Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) = disable NetBIOS via TCP/IP

Make sure that DNS-server addresses in Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) are set: 103.86.99.99 and 103.86.96.96

When using NordLynx tap-adapter driver change same DNS servers in NordVPN app or set to off but I have set to same as in TCP/IPv4: 103.86.99.99 and 103.86.96.96

All above must be changed if TCP/UDP protocol is used.DNS servers if using TCP/UDP protocol:103.86.96.100, 103.86.99.100

Under TCP/UDP I still have connection drops, but not under NordLynx.If you experience that remove NordVPN app and also all network drivers (but not driver of on-board network card), restart pc and perform installation again. That must help. I had several issues and you wouldn't believe it, but NordVPN Windows app was the cause.

I also wrote mail to NordVPN support with following context:""Hereby I resent my mail from two days ago. As you can see from my mail below I have sent my mail with few attachments and new created support ticket. I kindly ask to forward my case to higher-tech support and come back to me regarding my problem that. However I have already send a couple of times generated support tickets with NordVPN Diagnostic Tools and also apart mails with attachmentâ€™s which couldnâ€™t be sent due to connection drop issue. Since 14th of December 2021 Iâ€™m writing in vain. So, whatâ€™s the point of all possibility to generate a support tickets if support isnâ€™t on professional level and I as paid customer cannot rely on adequate service?""

Never got any answer after 2 mails!!!Also have send 5 support tickets created automatically with Diagnostic tools and manually (cause connection drop it canâ€™t be sent) with result: NO answer. Have wrote in vain many times!

My opinion: All VPN providers know about this issue (when you use TCP/IP or UDP protocol), but they donâ€™t want to admit it!Canâ€™t be solved and if so they donâ€™t have someone with deeply protocol knowledge, like Laura Chappell for example.

Reason no.1: NordVPN didnâ€™t reply to my mails in vain. Seems to me, cause they canâ€™t solve it!Reason no.2: Have also wrote that I have pc relatively powerful on which I can do what ever it takes, but also on this pc with minimal applications and without AV-solution (so on 3 pcâ€™s) have connection drop issues. As NordVPN didnâ€™t replied with any suggestion, to do this otherwise that: they know it canâ€™t be solved!If switched to IPv6, it will be different, but that time needs to come.

If switched to NordLynx I have no issues anymore. Fast connection and for now, for 4-5 days no connection drops. Tested speed with Ookla speedtest +/- 880 MB/sec up/down while connected to VPN with NordLynx protocol. During downloads with torrent is speed various: from 300-600 MB/sec. Tested speed with Ookla speedtest with TCP/IP or UDP protocol +/- 350 MB/sec while connected via NordVPN. So, this are the facts.",,,,not related,,,,

I own a media server thatâ€™s located a couple states away and is connected to a 1G symmetric network. Verified speedtest results. It has served about a dozen clients for several years with no speed issues. I moved a couple weeks ago and got my current xfinity plan. (The server is still remote, not on xfinity). My connection to the server on my new home network is abysmal. If I try to rsync/sftp files from the server to my home computer, the speeds are less than a MB/s, today it was 300KB/s. And the streaming speeds on plex are also terrible. With my connection I would reasonably expect to get >20MB/s transfer speeds over rsync.

Other clients can still access it fine. Because of this I believe the problem is occurring somewhere between my network and the servers network. Traceroute reports nothing out of the ordinary, 11 hops to destination, all response times are 30ms or less.

Anyone seen this before? Is there someone I can contact at Comcast that knows what theyâ€™re doing? I chatted with someone this weekend but all he wanted to do was reset my modem and ask me how many connections I have to my router.

Today, a store manager at one of our sites called me and said his internet was slow, so I remoted in and started running some speed tests. All of them came back as 10mbps/3mbps. But hold on a sec! The owner has been bragging about the ""blazing fast dedicated fiber"" we have at that location since I got hired. Surely he doesn't think THIS is fast!

 So naturally I asked the office manager to see our bill only to find out we are paying $355 a month for this slow service (in my area, there is a reliable company that offers 200/100 dedicated fiber for $200 a month).

Since it's my job to streamline our technology, I figured I would call the ISP (a local company) to ask about other internet plans. After all, this location has no need for dedicated fiber. Little did I know I would get some prodigy of a customer service rep that would share her wisdom of the internet with me.

>$CS: Can I get your account number?

She pulls up my account and there is silence while the gears turn. Certainly she is reading that we pay for dedicated fiber.

>$CS: Sir, it says here you pay for our 10/3 dedicated fiber connection, which comes inside your building and terminates into an Ethernet connection that goes to your computers, so I don't see what the issue is here. You have ethernet.

Hello denizens of reddit,

I have just finally received Starlink from Elon after waiting for about 15 months and my speeds have went from an entire 4.5 mbps dsl connection finally up to 150-200 and more. Finally out of the dark ages! ......Except for my one final problem, of course my personal gaming rig is having connection issues. For a bit of background, I have my Starlink setup through an Asus Mesh Wifi system which is sending the signal from our dish location to the main house mesh node and then sending out wifi and ethernet cords to the house.

Every device I have tested so far is getting very similar connection speeds for ping, download and upload except for my rig. I have tested connections to both ethernet and wifi (I only have a USB wifi adapter as my gaming rig was not intended for wifi use). I have been getting about double the ping and a third to a fourth of the download speed and almost nonexistent upload speeds.

I have also made sure that this is a pc issue and not a network or cord issue. If I plug my direct ethernet cord from my computer (where i'm getting a 40 mbps speedtest) into my brothers computer I get immediately a 150-200 mbps speedtest on his computer. Plug it back into mine and same issues. I've done the basic steps disable and re-enable my wifi and ethernet adapters, try to update drivers and such but nothing has worked.

My only lead so far is that my computer seems to be connecting to random servers. On my brother's computer on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net/) his location is in Seattle, Washington (The Starlink ground server we are connected too). However my computer is saying that my address is still in California and trying to move it to Seattle does not help, it shows as being some hundreds of miles away whereas on my brothers PC it shows 0 miles away. I also just tried reconnecting to ethernet after testing on wifi for a while and it threw my internet address all the way over to Kansas. I don't believe this is any sort of VPN as I have never set one up but possibly my computer is just assigning random ip's or something???

3.

294,"Hi all,

Bought a Nighthawk R7000P about two months ago because my ISP's routers were trash and constantly gave us trouble. I stream and work from home so having a stable internet connection is vital for me.

Anyhow, the past few days my upload speed has been horrendous, ranging from 2MB to 10MB making it impossible to stream. Previously I was getting 25MB to 40 MB/upload. For further context, I've called my ISP, they say everything on their end is fine. I've reset the modem and the router, checked that QoS is disabled, checked parental control was also disable, downgraded the firmware to [1.3.1.44](https://1.3.1.44) (apparently people have been having several issues with the latest firmware update) and reset the router again. Still having the same issue with upload speed.

Because of the way my house is set up and where the modem/router are, there's no way I can get a hard wired connection. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

**\*\*Update: I called Netgear customer service, they asked me to change two things in routerlogin: 1. In the ADVANCED tab: go to WAN settings, and change the MTU size from 1500 to 1492, and 2. in the BASIC tab, go to Wireless settings > 2.4Ghz Wifi > Channel > Auto to Channel 06\*\***

They also said to keep an eye on it for the next day or so, and if the problems persist to call again. I'm not entirely sure what tweaking these settings will do, if anything. Checking speedtest, my speeds are a little better 85MB/17MB (but more people are home using their devices), which is a little better but I could tell that the upload was still struggling quite a bit.

**\*\*Update Two: Called my ISP cause at this point I've ruled out everything I could think of/what the forums would be saying. All that's left is for a technician to check on the modem itself and see if that's causing the issue, or if any outside issue is causing my upload to tank. If not I'll be getting a replacement Nighthawk. \*\***

**\*\*Update Three: ISP came, did a few things, and concluded with: it's either 1. an ""area of service issue"" which I can wait out ""a month or so"" until the ISP fixes it (LOL), or 2. I could replace the router, which is what I'm going to do. If this doesn't fix it, at the very least I can rule out the Nighthawk wasn't the one causing the issues.\*\***",,,,configuration,troubleshooting,test results,,

For the past few months my internet on my computer has been highly inconsistent. By that I mean, it will never stay at a steady say 850mb down. What it is doing is starting out at a number between 300-800 and climbing for a bit, than dropping 150-200mb. Ie. it will start at 750mb, climb to 850mb than drop to 700mb within the span of a speed test.

It's a desktop computer with wired internet, router is right next to computer, joined by like a 3ft cable or something.

He said it was like an antenna spewing out frequencies that could have caused my intermittent connectivity. Signal on the new line looked good to him, speed test passed.

We have spectrum internet and speed test says we should get at least 150-200 mbps but when downloading anything on my Xbox my download speed is anywhere from 50 KBPS to 3mbps. Itâ€™s pretty ridiculous. I know spectrum is bad but holy this is just a problem. Iâ€™m unable to use a wired connection and DNS servers donâ€™t help as much as people say they do (at least for me) I canâ€™t even download a 2GB update until another 4 hours. I want any help I can get before modernwarfare comes out with another 60GB update and I wonâ€™t be able to play until a week after the update releases. Iâ€™ve also tried restarting my router and Xbox countless times. And although that method worked somewhat. Now it doesnâ€™t seem to help at all. Iâ€™ve tried restarting my Xboxâ€™s cache too. Sorry this post is so long but I need help before itâ€™s too late lol. Any help is appreciated.,,,,slow internet,gaming,test results,troubleshooting,

443,"I have my unraid server at location A which has symmetrical 100 mbps internet. And I am at location B which has 400/30 mbps internet. I am connected to location A's network using OpenVPN and with that, I am trying to transfer files over windows SMB. But for some reason, the files are only transferring at 355KB/s (roughly 2.8mbps) it sometimes shoots up to 20mbps but only briefly. The files I am transferring are a lot of pictures.

I am trying to troubleshoot the issue but I cannot seem to figure out where to go from here. I did speed tests on both ends and got the stated internet speeds. So importantly I am getting 30mbps up where I am and 100mbps down at the server. So it seems like I should be able to transfer at 30mbps but it is not.

Also of note, I am reading from an SSD and writing directly to the array (not the cache). No other write operations are occurring on the array.

Where should I proceed next with this troubleshooting?

271,"can you login to your router and check the internet connection from the router g.u.i?  some routers will let you run a speed test directly from the router.

if you cannot connect to some websites but you can login to your router and run a speed test then i would say your i.s.p is to blame. if you can't log into your router then i would check your signal/cable. i've seen cables chewed by puppies or mice that only do 10mpbs. try another cable if you can. try wireless if you can. try another computer if you can. replace your router once you've tried all the other options.",,,,advice,,,,
517,"People downvote you because that's not how the internet works.  Take Youtube for example, because it's easy to explain.  Between you and Youtube are thousands of different datacenters (DC), and when you go to a video, that video will only be held on a few. However, Youtube pays for space in local DCs to hold their advertising traffic so that they can provide targeted ads and reduce network congestion.  So you load up a video and the advertisement pops up immediately and looks great because it's coming from a DC fairly close to you.  And then the video takes a few moments to buffer, and often looks like crap at first until the bitrate can be negotiated up based on your connection.  This is slower because, odds are, that video is traveling to you from a further DC.
    
In the same vein, when you do a speedtest, you are reaching out to literally the closest server and testing the speed between you and there.  You are eliminating most of what makes the internet, the internet.  It'll show you issues that are local, but if there's something like a congested backbone beyond you and the speedtest server then it's not going to show any issues at all even if you're getting crap service.",,,,explanation,,,,
257,"I picked up a new Coolpad SURF from T-Mobile and I put on one month of data to try it out. Sadly, it is too slow for what I want to use it for.

My application is to watch Live TV in my vehicle.

I use an IPTV service that works great. I already have the Insignia TV (which has a built in Fire TV) hooked up in my car using a power inverter.

When I park outside my house and use my home WiFi the IPTV service works great.

But using the Coolpad SURF on T-Mobile just isn't fast enough because the picture keeps buffering.

I drove around and tried the Coolpad SURF in several locations. Running the Analiti speed test app on my Fire TV shows that it tops out at around 10-11 Mbps download speed and often is lower, as low as 5 Mbps.

Here is a picture of the IPTV service on my home Fire TV, which is connected to the internet via hardwired ethernet. I used the developer options on the Fire TV so that I can see how much data the IPTV service is pulling in real time.

As you can see in the picture below, the IPTV service can and does draw over 17 Mbps:

https://imgur.com/a/1JxnwAX

Usually it is only drawing about 6 Mbps but it often spikes to 17 or 18 Mbps.

So the speed of the Coolpad SURF with T-Mobile data just isn't going to work out because the connection is too slow.

I can return the Coolpad SURF no problem but I'm still unsure what to use that would have better speed. Ideally, I'd like a setup that can reliably get 25 Mbps to make sure that there is no buffering on the IPTV.

Is the speed that I am getting due to a hardware limitation of the Coolpad SURF, or is it a limitation of the T-Mobile data plan (or both)?

If there is a way to increase the speed I can get with the Coolpad SURF and T-Mobile or any other provider, I'm happy to try.

But I suspect I will need a better WiFi Hotspot or better Mobile internet service (or both).

Does anyone have any suggestions on either improving the performance with my current hardware and plan, or is there another setup that I should be considering?

386,"So I recently purchased a Dream Machine Special Edition as part of planning my new setup at my house I am building. I got it this week and decided to plug it in at my apartment to make sure everything works.

&#x200B;

My current internet is through Spectrum and I have a modem (Hitron EN2251) and router (Sercom  SAX1V1R) set up. I honestly do not have any real experience messing with ip addresses and what not, but I am a quick learner and figured this could not be too hard. I was not thinking initially and just plugged an ethernet line from my router into the WAN plug and plugged my PC into DMSE. The setup screen popped up on my pc web browser and I was ready to go, or so I thought. The setup process got hung up on trying to login to my Ubiquiti account. I downloaded the app for my phone and it did the setup process without issue and said the DMSE was ready to go. When I tried to use the internet on my PC though it said there was no internet connection. I could get internet connection to the DMSE, during the setup it did a speed test and everything and the speeds were what they should be. However, it would not pass that internet through to my PC that was plugged into the DMSE.

&#x200B;

I decided I should have probably just plugged the DMSE straight into the modem and not the router. I decided I was just gonna start over from scratch so I pushed the factory reset button. I plugged the DMSE WAN port directly into the modem and fired up the DMSE to do the setup again. Well this time it said it had no internet connection at all and could not get past that point.

&#x200B;

I tried using my browser to look at my modem settings by typing in the ip address. I tried typing in the standard  192.168.0.1 and  [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) and neither of those worked. I went ahead and unplugged the DMSE and got my modem and router setup that Spectrum gave me up and running again. Even then when I tried typing the standard ip address into my web browser, it would still not work. I could not access my modem or router using the ip address. I went into command prompt and entered the command ipconfig to see the ip address. When I did the default gateway ip address started with fe80 along with four other sets of letters and numbers and then it had the ip address listed as [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) after those sets of numbers and letters.

&#x200B;

Is the fe80 ip address going to interfere with using the DMSE? Do I need to call Spectrum and have them do something? I am at a loss.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I had started typing this and then walked away. When I came back I tried typing in the [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) ip address and this time it worked..... kind of. It took me to page generated by spectrum that showed all my router ip addresses and MAC address and what not and told me to download the Spectrum app to customize my network, manage devices, and change advanced settings like DNS, port forwarding, and more.

&#x200B;

FINAL UPDATE: So I unplugged my ISP provided modem and router and left it unplugged for about 15 minutes while I did something else in the house. When I came back I plugged the ethernet cable from my modem into my DMSE in the WAN port and then plugged my pc ethernet cable into one of the 8 poe ports on the DMSE. I then plugged the power into the modem and plugged the power into the DMSE. Once the modem booted up the DMSE was connected to the internet and the setup page popped up on my web browser. I set up everything and could see the DMSE was connected to the internet when it did the speed test as part of the setup. However, my pc was still saying it was not connected to the internet. I went ahead played around in the user interface for the DMSE and found the spot to update the firmware. My firmware was version 2.2.something. I updated to the latest firmware and once that was done my pc finally had internet connection passed through the DMSE poe port to it. I then was able to plug in one of my U6 Lite access points and follow some tutorials on how to set up a wireless network. It is about 1:30am at this point so I am gonna go ahead and finish following the setup tutorials I found tomorrow. Thank you so much to everyone that replied. Hopefully this post can help someone else in the future.",,,,not related,,,,
26,"I use a mainstream US VPN provider just for a tiny amount of anonymity on the web, and so my cell provider can't see every site I go to. I just feel like that's an invasion of privacy. I also figured that if I tethered another device to my phone, it would just look like normal traffic from my phone. I used to use it on my home internet, too, but I don't have that now since I'm traveling.

But today, quite by accident, I learned that the WiFi hotspot feature on my phone is ignoring my VPN connection! I ran a speed test on my tethered PC just to see what I get and was alarmed that it said ""AT&T Wireless"" as my provider instead of some random ISP name my VPN vendor uses. If I search ""my ip"" on both my phone and PC I get different results.

Why is this possible? Why does tethering traffic go around the VPN?

I've been tethering like this for months. Ever since I learned that I can get full speed if I tether a DD-WRT-equipped router to my phone instead of my other devices directly. If I tether my devices directly, I get capped at 128 kbps speeds. Presumably because Cricket can figure out that they are not requests from my phone. I knew about PdaNet for a long time, and that gives me full speed, too, but it's flaky, I would have to reconnect a lot, and only works for some devices. I tried using my router in split client-router mode for a reason I can't even remember and was really surprised that doing so gave all my devices full speed. So now I have my tablet, PC, and even my Roku tethered to my phone through my router. I figured since my phone used the always-on VPN with ""Block non-VPN traffic"", I was fine. :(

So, now I'm worried that my provider (which is actually Cricket which uses AT&T networks) is going to catch on that I've been tethering. They supposedly only allow it with ""compatible phones"", and with a 15 GB limit. (I think you can pay for more *a la carte*.) I used over 100 GB of tethering just last month. It's not unreasonable to use that much as a heavy phone internet user with streaming video, heavy reddit app usage, and miscellaneous downloads, so I figured my VPN gave me plausible deniability. Well, not any more.

(I can use OpenVPN from within the DD-WRT firmware to negate the issue going forward, but that doesn't really help now, since I'm sure they have logs.)

How fucked am I if they figure it out? Could they drop me without warning and make me lose the phone number I've had all my life? And why TF does Android not use my VPN for tethering traffic?",,,,not related,,,,

Actually Iâ€™ve an internet connexion that delivers me 400mb/s down and 20mp/s up.
About 4/5 month ago, I could have these speed on my PS4 slim (1To). And I could download games and updates really fast.
In exemple: an update of 2Go took less than 2 min.
And when I tested my connection via the settings, the down speed was around 350mb/s.
And now in the settings, I always have no more than 45 mb/s. The download of games and updates are so long right now...

Anyway, there is a positive thing in this. As the download take a long time, the PS4 as time to begin the copy. So, it take less time to install the files. Which was so long when I had the 400mb/s.
In a way, the time I loose in the download, I win it on the installation/copy of the game. And, I have absolutely no lag, ping,... while playing.

I juste wanna add 2 things before concluding:
1) I still have the top speed I my other devices (MacBook [ethernet], iPhone [wifi], Apple TV 4K[ethernet]. This issue appears only on my PS4.
2) That goes without saying, but my PS4 is connected via Ethernet.

For concluding, why do I have this change in download speed in a few month? Is this a change of Sony for loosing less time during the copy? But if it was that, why do I have so poor speed in the speed test (in the settings)?
Or is this coming from Sony server? Are they making any change for the ps5 coming?

I'm consistently getting less than 20 Mbps download and 2-3 Mbps upload using Wireguard now, which is less than OpenVPN. I used speedtest-cli to check if the RPi4 internet speeds were messed up with the router change, but I'm getting close to 90 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload, which is close to what my ISP provides, so I don't see a problem there.

I expected to see around the same performance. I assumed my VPN download speed would be limited by my upload speed of 20 Mbps. But I didn't expect it to be slightly less than even with OpenVPN which was running on hardware without AES encryption support.

To be honest, this is not a big deal, as my main goal in switching to Wireguard was to get something that connects faster and uses less battery on mobile devices.

Hi, I've probably tried everything in my knowledge to improve my WLAN connection to no avail.

Here's the situation, ever since I've set up plex on my pc and bought a quest 2, I've been trying to improve my WLAN speed in my room. For reference, my ISP speed is 200mbps up 200mbps down.

At first, I bought a tenda ac2100 [Amazon Product](https://www.amazon.com/Tenda-AC2100-Smart-Router-AC19/dp/B087YSYLYK), and was kinda happy with it until I decided to test my internet speed and local wlan speed. I used [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) to test it, and when I checked, my PC that is connected via LAN to the router achieve exactly the result that is promised by my ISP, even at a surplus of +- 10%. When I tried to run the speedtest from all of my wireless device, I somehow get a lower speed (about 80mbps down, 130 mbps up).

After that, to make sure that it was a WLAN problem I installed Iperf on my pc and my ipad, setting my pc as a serer. I get about 130\~160 mbps on my 5ghz wlan. I thought, well I must have been swindled somehow and get sold a counterfeit router or something, then I went and get the AX82U Since I've heard it's quite good. After setting it up, I found out that it performs exactly the same as the cheaper tenda, even though it has wifi 6.

My devices that I used to test (galaxy S10, IPad air 4, Iphone 12 mini, Macbook pro M1) all of them got the same speed, although the s10 sometimes get faster by 20\~30 mbps, but still very far from the promised speed of 5ghz ac or ax. I know that the speed noted in the box is theoritical speed, and we're supposed to get around 50% of it but I only get probably about < 10% of theoritical speed.

The 5ghz setting I have right now ischannel : 157 or 161 (some channel below 100, and my devices can't even see it)bandwidth : auto (with 160mhz enabled)Authentication : wpa2 personal

other than that I really don't change anything outside of the asus / tenda wizard screen 


 


\--EDIT--- SOLVED 
it was some region thing. In indonesia, some devices just refuse to use 80mhz bandwidth, no matter the channel. So what I did was to go inside my macbook/iphone/ipad setting and disable location access for network features. All the devices now correctly connect to wifi 6 with 80 mhz bandwidth and about 1200 Mbit/s link rate.",,,,troubleshooting,hardware,,,

So recently, I decided I wanted to set Hackintosh back up on my desktop.  My computer was originally a hackintosh, but then I upgraded my rig from an Intel i7 7700k to a Ryzen 9 3900x.  This obviously toasted my hackintosh side, so I purged the drive and kinda forgot about it for awhile.

After digging around, I stumbled across a site that goes through the step by step install (vanilla amd osx) using a tool called gibMacOS.  On first start, it worked **wonderfully**, however that wonderfulness quickly subsided to issue after issue.

The current problem I am experiencing with it is that all versions are displaying as ""Unknown - \*version here\*"" and some other identifiers with it.  I went in search of assistance on the AMD OS X Discord server, however my attempts were less than helpful.

[First menu options](https://preview.redd.it/tqt1iaq6gci41.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d09be0fbf71e534b5bec955adda14ce961fd0c4)

This is what I am greeted with after a lengthy waiting time for the terminal window to populate with options.  The tutorial said to enable restore only, so I did in hopes to attempt to navigate further into the install process.

[Restore menu options](https://preview.redd.it/iiaukzudgci41.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=909c61014aa48f5a20b536dd4763f3837d9441ca)

Once I toggled it and stood by for approximately 5 minutes or so, this appeared.  Same deal, except with *more* *unknowns*.  I sifted through and clicked option 5 as it seemed to fit what I should continue with (wanting a full install for Catalina 10.15.3)

Once I pressed the button and hit enter, 30 seconds passed and I was greeted with this.  The editor made the directory for the install but didn't actually download anything.    For reference, here is what the menu *should* look like:

[Tutorial page menu \(Source: vanilla.amd-osx.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/i062bgrtgci41.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2a64d97e4e0e0eb398bee203fbd99cff4fe8acd)

I have already gone through my rig and determined that all of my parts *should* be compatible.  However, it shouldn't be compatible with the parts causing this issue since this is a windows batch file.  I am running Python 3.7, and have tested it with 3.8 as well.  Both are downloaded from the Windows store, PC rebooted each time and made sure that the right aliases were being used in the windows settings.

Another issue which I thought could be the problem was my internet connection.  I don't have *great* internet, but it's certainly not bad.

I am also fairly confident it's not any of my machines as I tested the program on my Surface, my laptop, and my desktop.  My desktop is ethernet connected, laptop and tablet on WiFi.  I've also redownloaded the files from the github repository ( [https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS) ) to verify that I had the latest version.  Still nothing.

97,"Hey all.

Upgraded my PC with these parts today:


Motherboard:Gigabyte GA-AB350 Gaming 3

CPU: Ryzen 7 1700 CPU

RAM: 2x8GB DDR4 Corsair 3200 MHz

The parts is probably not too relevant, as me and a friend of mine with some different parts (also a Ryzen processor tho), has encountered the same issue.

We both did a fresh install of Windows 10 on our disks, but the issue now is that everything loads really really slow. Loading websites, streams, discord, everything that basically takes internet connection loads really slow.

The only browser that partly works is Microsoft Edge, which is really weird.

Has anyone encountered any similar issues? And does anyone know any potential fixes?


For my motherboard, I know that I am running not the latest update, but an update from April, I don't know how much this matters, but like I said, both me and my friend have encountered this same issue. Where all load is really slow, running games goes fine tho, just all other load where internet power is needed is slow.

Btw, speedtest.net gives 40 mbps down, and 20 mbps, about 40 ping, so there is no issue with the actual internet on the computer.


Anyone know what this could be?",,,,troubleshooting,hardware,,,
8,"One computer connected thru ethernet is getting speeds much lower than anything else on the network.

I've tried:
- New cords (cat 5, 5e, 6)
- A new router/modem combo
- New mobo drivers
- Bought a NIC which improved the download by about 8mb but did nothing for the upload
- Different ports on the router/modem
- No other programs running on the computer while speed test are being performed.

The slow computer is currently connected directly to the router/modem. The computer with good speeds is attached from router/modem --> switch.

I'm willing to list any other details y'all need. I'm going to try hooking up a different computer in the same conditions to determine if the issue is restricted to that computer. Just getting a little frustrated trying to fix this.

Appreciate any suggestions or feedback.

However, the wifi from the Bell home hub 3000 or if I connect our Google Nest Wifi routers, I am never able to get wifi speeds higher than 200 or 300 Mbps from the Bell connection.

I consistently get 450+ Mbps on wifi from our previous Rogers connection and through our Google Nest wifi.

46,"Iâ€™m going to mention this, only because I just went through it myselfâ€¦

I have good Internet speed (Fiber 1000mb/s). I have several CAT6 drops throughout my house. In all of them, I was getting the speed I expected (950 to 1000) but for some reason the one my Xbox was connected to was 90mb/s. After a bit of testing, I found that the issue was the cable. I plugged a laptop into the same cable, did a speed test, and it was also getting 90mb/s. After switching out the cable, I started getting the expected 950 to 1000mb/s. So thatâ€™s something you might want to check to confirm that the issue is the Xbox, or something else.

Other things to check can be, if you have the network cable plugged into a hub, other devices using that hub could be using up bandwidth.  Also, keep in mind that all of your devices have one pipe out to the Internet, so if you have something on your network using a lot of bandwidth, that could potentially effect other devices.

Finally, keep in mind, there are two sides to the download, so it could be on the Microsoft side. Unlikely, since Iâ€™m sure they have the hardware and bandwidth, but something to consider. For example, if I confirmed I had good speed on that cable, but the Xbox using Wifi and hard wired are getting the same speed, then it could be on the Microsoft side.

Anyway, good luck!",,,,advice,gaming,,,

104,"Hey all,

I'm replacing an Asus RT-AC68U in my parent's 3000 sq ft 2-story home with 600 Mbps cable. The cable modem is on the first floor of one side of the house. The upstairs master bedroom is on the second floor on the other side of the house, where the throughput and signal strength are pretty weak. I have about 25 devices total with a few security cameras, TVs, various smart home devices, and 3 laptops.

With the Asus I would get 220 Mbps close to the modem, 180-200 Mbps in the upstairs office, and \~50-90 Mbps in the upstairs bedroom. Over ethernet I get between 400-550 Mbps.

Today I tried the new Eeros, the Eero Pro 3-pack, and the Orbi RBK53 (router + 2 satellites).

I've read up a lot on this subreddit, on Wirecutter, and reviews on Amazon. I started with the new Eeros since they were on sale for $165 at Best Buy and hoped they would do the job, though I suspected that they wouldn't provide enough throughput to match the internet plan we have. The setup was painless, and the app was smooth - like people describe. Coverage was solid, as advertised, but the speed was not great.

So I returned them and bought the Eero Pro 3 pack, as well as the Orbis. So many people talk about unreliability, clunky setup, and bad firmware updates with the Orbi's but I figured I would give them a chance. The Eero Pros did better with speed tests, but not as good as the Orbis. I will say the Orbi setup for me was indeed a pain in the ass. For some reason the first time I set up the network to the same name as the old network, none of the devices would connect. After changing the SSID the satellites dropped. The reboot sequences after changing setting was painfully slow and sometimes required manual intervention. I had none of these setup issues with either Eero variant.

But the thing is, the Orbi's are just faster with identical placement compared with the Eero Pro 3 pack. I want to keep the Eero Pros, I have a suspicion that I'm going to get bit by those random drops/bad firmware updates/instability that everyone talks about. Are the Eero Pros just slower? I did make sure to do the firmware updates on all devices I tested (Eeros, Eero Pros, Orbis). Placement between them was all like for like.

431,"First and foremost, I love my Eero Pro 6â€™s. Right now, they seem to be the solution that I needed and I may be â€œlooking for problemsâ€ because the techie side of me just canâ€™t handle that something was this easy and simple and didnâ€™t need any tweaking â€“ or really any input â€“ from me.

A little background about how I got here:

My home internet has the main cable drop near the center. It's beautiful that itâ€™s centrally located and is where I had my modem and my single router located before my journey started. Probably around 95% of the time my overall Wi-Fi worked without too much issue; however, I had a lot of hiccups. The computers in my office would randomly drop to the 2.4GHz band. Sometimes, when I was gaming in that room I would just get unexplained stutters or just feel like my gameâ€™s â€œtimingâ€ was off for a few seconds. And I also had to â€œwalk my scaleâ€ from the master bath out to the main living area every couple of weeks so it could sync.

So, I bought a single WiFi 5 router and had it in the same central location. Things seems a little bit better. I hardly ever bufferedâ€¦ but still would occasionally. Sometimes my Pandora on my work PC would just say it did not have connection. My gaming computer would still sometimes just feel lag when no one else in game was.  At this point, I started testing my signal strength in my office and in my master bedroom. I was testing in at RSSI 65+ almost all the time on my 5GHz band. It was horrible to see those numbers. I thought they had to be wrong since â€œmostâ€ of the time I was fine.

Anyroads, I decided since running wire drops into the back rooms is just not feasible that I would look into a wireless mesh kit. This how I ended up with the Eero Pro 6 3 router pack. I bought it and LOVE IT. Nothing is lagging, nothing is disconnecting, and nothing is dropping to the 2.4GHz band that shouldnâ€™t be there.

Now on the issue. I keep reading about all these issues with oversaturation and having them too close together. I tried just using one of the routers centrally located. Unfortunately, I got an -67  in my office and was at -72 in my master bedroom. At this point, I went ahead and plugged in the other 2. One at one end of the house in my office for my work and gaming PC (and other office-y things) and one at the other end of the house in the master bedroom for my scale andâ€¦ well my scale.

I am now enjoying a connection of around -35 in all rooms if connected to the closest router. About 65-70 if Iâ€™m at the second closest and 80+ on the furthest. Here is the catch; MY HOUSE IS SMALL AT ONLY 1,500 SQUARE FEET.

Iâ€™m not sure why my house just seems to swallow WiFi beams. I do have block construction and metal studs. Is that enough to just make my house a horrible Wi-Fi zone? Iâ€™m not having any issues even though my routers are probably only 30 to 40 feet from each other. They all have at least 2 walls between them and sometimes major appliances like refrigerators and ovens and microwaves. In fact, everything is FANTASTIC and fast as can be. But I keep wondering if I am having issues with oversaturation and donâ€™t know it. My Dad keeps telling me I spent too much and should be able to cover my house easily with 1 router. I tried for a couple days. Sure enough, I did great on the speed tests, but in the real world I kept feeling stutters again in my game and I noticed YouTube occasionally buffering and my VPN speed on my work computer was abysmal. Plugged in the other 2 and itâ€™s all smooth sailing again.

Am I just looking for problems? I am ok with the money spent if it means smooth internet all over my house. Thatâ€™s not a problem. Does anyone else need this type of coverage in such a small space? If I am having issues with oversaturation, what would that look like? Is there a way to test if for that sort of interference?

In the end, I think Iâ€™m still just looking for something to mess with. I want to have some setting to tweak and canâ€™t handle these babies worked right out of the box as promised, but would appreciate input.",,,,not related,,,,

588,"It would help if you could provide the modem model and router model. There is a sticker on the back of each that you can look at to identify this information.

While many in this post have suggested getting your own modem/router, sometimes just having Spectrum replace the Modem and router for you can solve the problem.

Some things that could be causing issues:

* The modem
* The router
* The network cable you use
* a Coax line inside of the home
* the Coax line from the pole to your home

I would start by getting a technician dispatched to the house to check the signal of the cables within your home. They may need to replace the ends of the coax line or or an entire line or  your splitter.  There could also be a problem with the connector rails on the telephone pole.

You may also want to look into purchasing a quality Network cable from Amazon. I would get a CAT6A Shielded as they aren't much more expensive than CAT6 Cables.

Have the technician replace your Modem and Router.

Try speed tests after the replacements.

Given that a technician has already been there, I would call customer support and review the notes from the technicians with a Customer Support Rep to see if they have done these things I mentioned. Also, request a senior technician to come out.

 I can tell you from February to April of this year I had to have 6 visits from Spectrum technicians for consistent disconnects with my modem losing connection every few hours. They replaced literally everything eventually only to find out that the NEW modem they had given me at the 3rd visit was bad on arrival and needed to be replaced. I understand it is frustrating, but please understand that there are so many reasons for why your connection can be bad that it takes patience, kindness, and several attempts to get to the root cause sometimes.  Please be kind to your spectrum reps and let them help you. In the end, it will get resolved.

On a side note, I am a tech guy that loves cool new gadgets. I use Spectrum's modem paired to a Netgear Orbi RBK752 Mesh Wifi system.

I have been reading the sub for a while now, since about July of last year. I have absorbed a lot of info and learned a lot of unwritten rules and I appreciate all of the wonderful examples of this community helping new people out.

Now I am here hoping that I can get a little bit of that help for myself.

TL:DR, I am tired of my commodity routers randomly taking a crap and I am ready to upgrade to something more configurable and controllable. I would love some suggestions. I have included all info I can think to include below. The current idea is pfSense handling the network and router acting as wifi AP. I would appreciate any advice you can give.

Below here is info on my current network and connection speed as well as current equipment in use and available to me. Skip to the end for questions if you do not need the specs.

---

**Current setup.**

My home network starts with gigabit fiber from an externally mounted ONT that is fed to an Asus Rt-Ac68u with the newest Asus-Merlin firmware. 
No AI items or QoS are turned on, it is handling just DHCP, DDNS, wireless (2.4 and 5), and port forwarding. 

This lives on the main floor of the home, it has one PC connected to it, it then feeds an 8 port gigabit switch in the basement that everything else on the network branches off from. The other 2 ports are unused.

I have been experiencing random issues and problems with downloading, lack of speeds, saturation issues between machines, disappearing networked machines, and overall, just an unacceptable amount of issues that causes the family to say ""Dad why isn't this working"" way too often. And recently, as in last night, it just decided to start limiting my download speeds to 900k while still allowing 150Mb upload. For reference, I should be getting 1g down, 250meg up.

Fast.com shows full speed, as does my ISP speed test, however, testmy.net shows an average of 3 megs over a number of tests, and downloads via Usenet providers that have traditionally given me full speeds, are now working at dial-up speeds. Traditional file downloads are also just as slow and often time out.

When removing the router and connecting directly to the ONT, all of the issues are resolved, so the issue is definitely the router.



**I have the following devices active.**

1 older i5 machine in the basement running Windows 10 and all software packages to support the network. Hardwired.  

5 main windows PC's each directly wired. these are used for gaming, media consumption, and general streaming, and school work.   

4 Hard wired high-definition security cameras.  

6 wireless high-definition security cameras.  

6 to 7 Relatively modern cell phones.  

3 Laptops that switch between wired and wireless. Each one is at least 5 years or older.   

2 smart TVs on wireless (wired port is limited to 100meg so wireless is faster, go figure).  

10 Google nest devices, mostly minis. 
 
20 smart lights.  

7 smart outlets. 



**Software currently running on the i5 machine to handle the network items.**

Blue Iris for the cameras.  
Plex.  
Sonarr. 
Radarr.  
Ombi.  
Tautulli.  
Headphones.  
SABnzbd.  
Home Assistant. 



**Available hardware.**

2 Mid spec 5-year-old machines. Think i5 with 8 gigs of ram and commodity gigabit nic cards.  

Google wifi (1st one, not the speaker one) that is currently unused.  

2 TP-link tl-sg108 and 2 tl-sg108. 

Netgear gs108t. 

Linksys sd2008 Rev 3. 

3 fully working Asus rt-ac68u's.

---

With all of that said, I think at this point I am ready to use one of my older machines to host my network and do the heavy lifting for DNS, DHCP, NTP, QoS, and all things network-related. Then I can use the Asus RT-AC68U as a basic wifi AP and offload all of the heavy lifting to something more capable.

Each time I have researched this I have always come back to pfSense as making the most sense both from an economical standpoint, which is important to me considering after having to close my business money is rather tight, as well as a robustness and a thriving community offering support and a huge amount of institutional knowledge.  

So, given what I have to work with.

Would it be a good idea to use one of the mid-spec macines to run pfSense to handle all of the network related items such as DHCP, DDNS, DNS, Firewall, VPN, Port forwarding, etc, and then use the available switches to hard wire as much as is possible, and then finally have the Asus routers just act as access points and wireless?

I want to be able to seperate out the IoT items and block internet access, and put the cameras on thier own subnet and bassically do the secure things I should be doing, instead of the clusterfrig I have now.

88,"Im using a Razer Blade 15 Advanced (early 2019 model) and have a standard rj45 cat6 ethernet cable from my NBN home network router connected to my lenovo thinkpad dock which is also a hub for all my peripherals, connected to my laptop through thunderbolt 3 usb-c. 
Now when I enable usb debugging for network sharing on my phone and connect my phone to the dock through usb-c to usb-c (which the pc recognizes as a wired internet connection) my internet speeds are noticeably quicker, and I mean in just basic scenarios such as opening and loading webpages and the like.

 


But here's when thing's get tricky, and the reason I'm posting this in a veil of confusion, 


When I run a standard internet speed test (by Ookla) on multiple different servers, the general result I get is around 45Mbps for both connections with some servers hitting as low as 25Mbps on my mobile connection. 
But the ping latency value is twice to three times slower on my mobile connection, and from what I understand, the ping is the server response delay in ms. 
So on my standard home wired connection I get about a 6ms ping, but on my mobile connection I cant get any lower than 15ms ping. 
Based on these numbers and from what I understand, this would indicate that my wired home internet connection should be faster than my wired mobile internet.

But somehow when I open webpages on my wired mobile internet, the pages, or videos, load almost instantly, whereas for my home internet, I find myself having to consistently wait a few seconds at the very least, to sometimes even waiting over a minute and just assuming something is wrong with the webpage then trying to refresh the page to no avail. 


&#x200B;

In sure there are a lot more values to consider when trying to understand how the speed of an internet connection works other than just the network bandwidth and latency, but how do I identify it?  
and more importantly, how do I fix it? 


&#x200B;

I couple other things probably worth mentioning;  
I made sure to unplug either internet connection from the dock when I wasn't using it to make sure it was giving me correct data. 
When I run a speed test on my mobile device itself, I get about 75Mbps and about the same ping. 
This slowness isn't consistent, majority of the time my home internet connection is completely fine and comparable in speed to my mobile's connection in real world use.

216,"Hey everyone,

I live in a Chicago condo, and originally I set up my internet in my living room since that's where my PS4, etc. were. Since then I've built a PC that I keep in my second bedroom. That room has its own coaxial port that I'd like to move my modem / router setup so I can connect my PC via ethernet.

Comcast is saying that it'd be $30 to send a technician to activate that port, but is there any way that I can do that myself?

Thanks in advance for your help.

EDIT 1 (from the comments):
Some further information: I'm pretty sure that our box is up by my furnace, as when I first had my internet hooked up I remember the tech going up there.

Opened up the box and this is what's there:
http://i.imgur.com/ls7eoLd.jpg

Pretty sure the connection on the far right is the main? Not sure if I should just swap these and see which works. Don't want to break my net though.

EDIT 2:

Connected the yellow cable to the ""in"" on the splitter and the remaining cable to the out. It worked! Which is a relief, but now it looks like I occasionally get speed drops on the modem. Normally I'm sitting around 29-30 Mbps, and it will occasionally drop as low as 0.1-0.05 (sometimes speedtest can't even finish).
Could this be because of losses on the splitter?

15,"Hiya fellows.  i'm in a moment of despair and trying to figure on what to do next.  I've got my setup as a PC upstairs(2f) that i built a few years ago with the help of r/buildapc.  Been great ever since and playing games like D3, FH4, SC2, Rocket League, Destiny 2 etc and all on WiFi upstairs for years while the router is downstairs(1f) directly below me.  I'm surprised I've never had issues with connectivity with only a 20Mbps even though I've only seen speeds of up to 10Mbps when running speed tests online.  But for some reason i'm getting anywhere between 2-7 Mbps for about the past week....and an unplayable amount of lag.  Ping 30ms  7Mbps down and 2Mbps up was tested while typing this up.  Connectivity is also shitty in the basement TV but idgaf about that bc i never use it....gaming is my biggest concern.  So I've been looking into maybe running an Ethernet but that would entail making a hole in the wall of my home and i'm not about that really.  So i found Power line/ whatever you wanna call it  TL-PA7010KIT on amazon and the reviews and YouTube videos seem great.  Minus the fact that some of the videos are pretty old and that power line connectors give you slight bit less of max speed compared to a direct connection to router.

&#x200B;

So minus the backstory and my situation has anyone else looked into and or is using a power line thingy for their gaming?  Other then current situation I've tried powering off the router for a min, make a drink, plug it back in and then go back upstairs and see the internet get back up to about 10Mbps and then it'll fall again.  Idk if i'm being throttled by my ISP or its just a congested time of day but for a whole week I've been kinda pissed i can't play APEX or any of my games i usually play .  So VPN was also something i was looking at but it seems that a VPN doesn't necessarily speed up your internet but it does fix a possible throttle issue.  So has anyone else been having a troublesome time with something they have had fun doing the past then all of a sudden your dreams are crushed and you just don't know what to do!?

&#x200B;

I am going to set up desktop on the first floor and directly connect to router and test the WiFi at close range and see what kind of results i get.  Bc if i do get this thing off amazon i'll have something to compare it to if the close up/ direct connect results even improve current situation.  Thanks in advance for any help.  Since i'm not gaming i should be quick with replies if you have any......and honestly i'm hoping this is the right place to inquire about this bc it is a PC intended part even though you can use it on diff Ethernet devices like consoles n such",,,,troubleshooting,hardware,slow internet,seeking recommendations,
561,"I know it sounds dumb, but hear me out.

So I've been moving stuff around and I've put my new Series X on my computer desk about 4 feet from my computer. There's a monitor in between the two devices and everything this situated from the router diagonally down in the basement about 15 feet away from each other. There's a wooden floor and some walls between my desk and the router. This layout makes the xbox closer to the router than my laptop.

When I moved everything together I noticed that YouTube videos would take forever to load. A quick speed test showed that my usual 60mBps down load speed was reduced to 4mBps. The annoying thing is that it seemed that the connection was hiccuping with frequent disconnections every 5-10 seconds. These were long enough to load parts of a video and then give me a buffer icon and a 30 second wait before the video started again at a lower quality.

For fun, I decided to fully shut down my Series X and load a video. After about 30 seconds, my laptop was loading pages like it was nothing. I decided to do a bit of an experiment.

* I pulled up the YouTube home page and timed how quickly it loaded. I then turned on my Series X from a cold boot and refreshed the page. Still like new.
* I loaded up a The Witcher 3 and the quick resume kicked in. It was like the game was never closed. I refreshed the page on my laptop and it still was fast.
* I kicked on Uno and quick resume started. I loaded the page and there was a very, very slight delay. I figured it wasn't that big of a deal.
* I loaded up destiny 2 and then refreshed. A slightly longer delay.
* I loaded up Apex Legends, refreshed the page, slightly noticable delay.
* I loaded up Spyro, noticeable delay.
* I loaded up Assassin's Creed Unity, this was when there was a 3 second delay before the page refreshed.
* Loaded up No Man's Sky, about a 6 second delay from the lap top.

This went on as I opened more games on my Series X and I figured there was a connection. This was when I decided to hard shut down my xbox and unplug it completely. When I did I refreshed YouTube and the loading speed went back to instantaneous.

My second test was loading up World of Warcraft and hovering over the ping indicator. For those that don't know, when you hover over the settings button, it shows local and world delay. Usually for when I play, I sit around 20-30 ms of world and local ping. Sometimes it jumps to 120ms world ping but it's not noticable.

I did the above test while having WoW open and as I opened more games, the ping went from 20-30 ms delay to nearly 3000ms. When I hard shut down my Series X and left WoW to run for a bit it started dropping down from 3000ms to 1000ms over a period of 2 mins.

So I know it's a very crude experiment but I've been wondering for anyone else, has this happened to you?

126,"Power went out last night for a few hours due to a lightning strike some miles away. Upon rebooting, my internet speed tests @ ~ 100 kbps.

I've unplugged/replugged everything, rebooted the modem multiple times, reset the modem's' config to factory defaults, updated the firmware, reset my internet connection to CL defaults, tried OpenDNS DNS servers, tried a newly made default connection, swapped network cards, tried a different CL modem, rebooted the PC and nothing has helped. Still ~ 100 kbps.

Lightning did not run into the house, as the storm was several miles away; no other issues. Had phone service throughout the power outage & phone service remains functional.

I had the same problem last year from a thunderstorm, the tech at that time could not find anything wrong but opted to ""rebuild your [my] connection"" on the CL system end & that fixed it.

Calling CL TS this AM did not resolve the issue & I'm currently at the same 100 kbps [less than 2x dialup speed.  Loading any reddit page takes ~ two minutes, as does pretty much anything Web 2.0 and beyond]. The techs could not find anything wrong, but said they would not rebuild the connection on the CL side as they found nothing wrong, opting instead to have a tech come out Wednesday, 08/08.

Pretty sure something got fried line-, central office-wise, as nothing inside the house shows any indication of being fried. I find the lack of a ready solution frustrating, as this seems to be the same problem from last year that was a ~three minute fix once initiated, but I need to wait until August 8th, for some unknown reason [originally 08/15, but the very kind supervisor and tech rep helped to get a better scheduling date].

I just don't know why a connection rebuild wasn't allowed, as that was what fixed the problem the other time even though the tech couldn't see a problem on the CL end. The tech support staff were very nice and tried to be helpful, but it seems they aren't allowed to try to rebuild the connection, but wouldn't it be a cost-saving measure to try it, rather than to have a field tech come out? I already stated I won't be paying any charges related to that, as I've verified the inside lines and hardware are not problematic, and my previous experience with the same problem indicates the same.

30,"I'm curious what kind of problem could cause the issue I've had twice now.

A few weeks ago, I was getting about 50-60% packet loss. Checking the connection data on my modem (Motorola MB7621), it was using channels 21-44 and they all had SNR around 28-29 dB. It should be 35 dB or above. Power levels were fine. Uncorrected error rate of about 250k/second.

I called Comcast and they did the usual checking modem status and resetting it. After the reset my packet loss was much better, but still there. Checking the stats the modem was not using channels 1-24. Channels 1-7 (423-459 MHz) had SNR between 32 dB and 33 dB (low, but getting no uncorrectable errors). Then from 8-15ish the SNR fell off to 28-29 dB and the error rate rose, and the rest of the channels remained in 28-29 dB.

Something seemed to adapt to this disparity, and my packet loss dropped to 0, with speed tests giving about 25-30 mbps instead of the usual 125 mbps.

Comcast scheduled a tech to come out two days later. Shortly after that, the packet loss as back up to 50%, and checking the modem it was now on channels 21-44 again.

I resigned myself to a weekend without internet (this was a Saturday morning). but then a couple hours later I got a text from Comcast saying that had fixed the problem that was affecting service in my area, and asked if I still needed the tech.

I checked the modem and everything was back to a normal 35 dB or higher, and I cancelled the tech appointment.

Well, now it is doing the same thing again. The same 28-29 dB and it is on 21-44. When they or I reboot, it starts out on 1-24, with the same good low frequencies and the same fall off starting around 460 MHz, and the same switching to to 21-44 later. And I again have a tech scheduled.

The only thing different so far is that the modem switched back to 1-24 after a while, and I was getting slow but loss free service for about 30 minutes, but now it is getting 70% packet loss even with 1-8 not getting any errors.

Today is a colder day than the surrounding days were, and I remembered it also being a cold day the previous time this happened (and a check of the records of a nearby store that runs a weather station with past days records online confirms it).

The prior time was on a day that had a low of 27 F. The low was 30 the day before and 40 the day below that, and 39 the day after. My recollection is that the previous day did not have much of a high.

Today it is happening when it is 28. As with the prior time, previous days did not get as low.  This time it is happening in the evening, and it never got about maybe 34 all day.

So...any ideas what would cause this? It should be something that:

1. doesn't happen unless there have been several hours of below freezing temperatures,
2. lowers SNR across the board, but it affects channels above around 15 significantly more than those below around 8, and
3. Comcast can at least sometimes fix it quickly from their end.

(Oh, nice. It has apparently figured out again how to just use 1-8, and so I'm back to no packet loss).",,,,troubleshooting,inconsistency,hardware,,

14,"I have been communicating with ProtonVPN for many, many months.  I have provided them many, many speedtest results, as well as network analyses.  I have pointed out that having only two Plus Servers in the US Mid-Atlantic is insufficient.  I have provided data showing the two Plus servers maxed out while the two Basic Servers remain at moderate capacity.  I have indicated the number off times I have lost connection and been reconnected with servers in New York, New Jersey, Florida, and even Utah.  I have asked them to consider adding more servers -- but also transferring at least one of their basic servers to a plus server for their paying customers.

As the title of this post says, I simply do not understand the ProtonVPN Business Plan. One would thionk that given the size of the population of the US Mid-Atlantic region, its proximity to a major internet hub, and the degree of business located in the National Capital Area, one might think that providing superior service would yield a significant increase in customer interest.  Over the last year, perhaps one might even see at least one plus server added to the mix.  If I look at the number of Plus servers in the New York-New Jersey area (which has a population of 10-15 million people), there are 34  Plus servers and 13 Basic servers.  In the Mid-Atlantic Region, with an equivalent population stretched from Delaware through Maryland, Virginia, West Viriginia, and the Carolinas, there are two Plus Servers and two Basic servers -- again -- a stone's throw from a major internet hub.

Now one might assume that being so close to a major internet hub would result in exceptional connection speeds and throughputs.  If that were only the case.  Whoever ProtonVPN users as their network provider, they simply can't handle the load and it is beyond me how ProtonVPN tolerates their poor service.

Caveat -- My perception comes from using a Mac as my primary platform, although my windows machines suffer similar problems and I sometimes find them connected to servers far afield -- even in Europe.  So why am I sticking with ProtonVPN?  I would like to see them be successful.  I would like them to really take a hold of this problem and solve it.  That's why I have spent the time providing them with analyses and feedback -- but it is still unclear to me why they do not have their own remote monitoring capability for both users of all platforms.

So -- please shift at least one of the Virginia servers from Basic to Plus and provide a timeframe to increase the server footprint in the US National Capital Area by at least 100% over the next six months.  That is the best advice I can provide.",,,,not related,,,,

Did that, and I only just booted it back up, but it seems to run perfectly now. Hope this information is helpful to someone.

\------------------ 


I joined Stadia two Sundays ago and for the first week, it worked pretty good â€” not perfect, but certainly well enough to play â€” and was real excited. Excited enough that I gladly signed up for a Pro account.

Then ever since Sunday, I cannot get a good connection. The system will start and tell me it's an excellent connection, but once actual gameplay starts, the connection is either fair or unstable, and the games are unplayable. The lag is such that my player in NBA will run right off the court, or in Red Dead, I'll run off a cliff. I contacted Stadia via twitter Sunday night and we went back and forth for five hours. All the tips they offered me are things I'm already doing, inapplicable, or, in some cases, it was worse. Some details:

\- MacBook Air mid-2012 with ethernet connection- Incognito mode with no extensions- set to limited data in the mobile app- Download speeds of around 247 Mbps according to [projectstream.google.com/speedtest](https://projectstream.google.com/speedtest) (around 105 with Wifi, which the same site also tells me is fine for Stadia but I switched to ethernet anyway)- reset my router multiple times, no effect- turned off location services - seemed to work for a minute but then was still a bad connection- no other devices using internet at same time as when I'm playing- Turning off hardware acceleration had no effect (it was worse afterwards, but that is probably a coincidence)- Javascript is enabled- No firewall rules restricting traffic, not using VPN

I had the same connection problems all day Monday, tried again this morning and it's still unplayable. I canceled my Pro account and tried to get refunds for the games I purchased, but because I already played them for more than 2 hours during that first week when things were decent, I'm stuck with games that I cannot play. It's really frustrating.

Any tips you guys have would be most appreciated â€” I really like the idea and I haven't owned a console in forever, but at this point I think I may have to drop money on a physical console.",,,,advice,gaming,,,

Last September 7, 2017, I've decided to apply for my own internet plan (our current internet plan is under my Tita's globe account). I needed a faster internet speed and a higher data cap for my online work and our current internet plan (GoFast1599) just isn't enough for me anymore.

I availed GOBIG1899 (DSL) which includes 500GB of internet data, 100GB data for youtube, 50mbps speed, Netflix, HOOQ, Disney, and a Landline unit.

So far, I AM VERY SATISFIED! :)
I do speedtests via Ookla everyday and I consistently get an average of 49mbps~ download speed and 13mbps~ upload speed in every result. So far, so good. Hopefully this will last for 2 years haha (I have a 2 yr contract with globe).

I only paid an advanced payment fee of 1899 upon installation. No more! :) Apparently, globe has a promo and they're offering free installation (I'm not sure until when). No fees for the landline unit as well.

**PROS**

1. I get a very satisfying internet speed. A whopping 49+ mbps! :D
2. A large data cap + 100gb more for youtube :D
3. I get to have 300 pesos rebate for 3 months! :D (I will only pay 1599 for the first 3 months :D)
4. It's one of globe's fiber plans
5. The landline offers unli calls to globe/tm numbers (both mobile and landline)
6. The landline offers unli calls to other network's landline as long as it's within Metro Manila or have the same (02) area code.
7. I can download 1GB worth of *digital stuff* via torrent and direct within 5mins! :P

**CONS**

1. The landline unit doesn't have a phone box. It's directly connected to the modem. There's no splitter. This means that if I turn off my modem, my landline unit will be off as well. :)) I find this very ridiculous. Really. :)) So yes, I have no choice but to leave my modem open 24/7 if I want to have a 24/7 functioning phone. :)) When I asked if globe will ever provide fix for this, the installer simply told me ""hindi na po, eh"". HAHAHA!

2. GOBIG1899 is one of globe's fiber plans BUT- the *cabinet* in my area doesn't support fiber lines so my connection isn't really fiber. At least that's what I understood from what the installers told me.

3. GOBIG1899 is *NOT RECOMMENDED* for online gamers, the ping is high when you play online games (as per the installer). This doesn't bother me though b/c I don't play online games anymore and I'm using my internet now for work and other *guilty pleasures* :^ )
--



**TIPS:**

1. Not all globe broadband plans are available in all locations. Check with globe (via hotline) what internet plans are available in your area. Also, don't be satisfied just by talking to one agent on the phone. If you have to call many times just to be sure you're getting the right info, do it. As for my case, I really wanted to get GOBIG1899 because it's a very, very good deal. My first calls with globe agents via hotline isn't in my favor. I always get told that GOBIG1899 isn't available in my area until I called several times and spoke to different agents and I finally got an answer that GOBIG1899 is available in my area and I'm eligible to apply for the installation. :P

2. Globe fiber plans start at plan 1899 (GoFast or GoBig)

3. You can apply for an internet plan via hotline, website and globe stores in malls (I applied via hotline)

4. Globe's fiber plans start at plan 1899 (GoBig or GoFast) for both DSL and LTE.

Setup

RPi4

Netgear router/gateway (comcast) home network that came with network, \~10 devices 802.11 a/n/ac, all devices on same LAN behind router.

Windows 10 laptop

Mullvad VPN

5-bay USB enclosure w/ 5 HDs

Goal:

1. Configure Raspberry Pi to connect and transfer from devices on LAN and over internet.
2. Transfer files to Pi over LAN and over internet to external USB storage.
3. Configure Pi to run off Kodi and run media over HDMI cable to TV
4. Configure Pi to run off Kodi and allow for streaming to remote connections.

Configure

Problem 1:

Samba connection on wifi over LAN is super unreliable. Transfer speeds on network are below 7Mbps for all files, including files greater than 1gb. I have tried to transfer files on several different networks and with SCP. Wifi connection is strong. Networked drive set to IP address, not hostname. Files will transfer for several minutes then they will timeout and drop. Reinitializing the Pi did not fix this issue. Running a speedtest and downloading files from online resources gives me download speeds at 16Mbps.

Problem 2:

Using NextCloud, I was able to locate files on device on the network using UI, however, I am unable to view external drives after setting the mount points to the data directory. Files/Folders created on NextCloud appear on File Directory in Raspbian, but mounted drives do not. Attempted to refresh NextCloud with no success. Google searches lead to possibility that NextcloudPi is the way I need to view external drives, however, I'm unable to find configuration options for USB device connections, so this is turning into a bigger headache than I'd like.

\------

Since I'm not able to get basic file directories up and running, I haven't bothered trying to do remote connections or to configure Kodi yet. My storage needs are not torrent related, so I don't want to configure the device to act as a download hub, eliminating the need for SMB reliability.

121,"I think everyone agrees. Ultimately this is just like the fuel consumption label on a car ""lab environment"". We all want highly accurate figures of the real world. The issue is no one knows what the actual figure is until it is tested.

This is the thing with the internet. ISPs have only minor control over the internet. Sure they can limit your speed on their end, but they cannot guarantee a minimum speed. Even if you knew what the minimum guaranteed speed was it would be pointless because you'll never see it. It would be like knowing what the slowest speed a car will move without stalling. Its a pointless figure.

Sure you can gauge how good an ISP from forums but even then your experience will be vastly different from others. An ISP wouldn't even know what speed you'll get until you order a service. Even then, run a speedtest to two different locations overseas, you'll get two very different figures for your speed.

The only way an ISP could even vaguely give you a guaranteed speed would be a point to point service. Which would be pointless because that's not the internet.

301,"I was one of the many people who recently tried Stadia during the 2 months of Stadia Pro and I have been absolutely loving it. It didn't take long before I purchased the premiere edition so I could play with a controller and CCU in the living room.

Stadia has been great but one of the things that it has brought to my attention is that my home network isn't as great as I thought it was.

**My home network** 
I have Spectrum as an ISP giving me 400Mbps down and 20Mbps up with a \~20ms ping on average. My house is a relatively good size (\~3000 sq/ft) so I had purchased the three-point Google Wifi Mesh system about 2 years ago. The mesh networking has been wonderful for giving my house blanket Wifi coverage and for Stadia it was relatively decent as I could even set Stadia traffic to be prioritized.

We have a lot of devices in the house and when I was playing stadia from a computer it was either on a hardwired connection to a desktop or a Macbook Pro connected at 5Ghz.

I noticed that if I played on the laptop and I was connected to the main Wifi point (that is directly connected to the modem) that the games ran great with zero issues or frame drops. However, when I tried playing sometimes between the second and third mesh point I would get horrible lag, frame drops, and sometimes even just games quitting outright. This is the kind of experience I imagine some get on Stadia and its not the direct fault of Stadia but it certainly is a challenge to the success of the service.

**My Problem** 
I realized that the Google wifi endpoints didn't have their own dedicated channel for backhaul communication back to the main router and as a result it was doing a lot of wifi hopscotch sending packets back to the main router in between sending packets and getting packets from the connected laptop. My mesh points are well within range of each other and I can run speed tests connected to those points and get 20ms ping and up to 100Mbps down bandwidth with no reported packet loss. This is why the lack of a dedicated backhaul was completely unnoticeable when doing multiple video conferences or playing online with games that were local as the data throughput wasn't as demanding and the occasional packet delay didn't add a very noticeable hiccup in those uses.

Only the high demands of Stadia really showed this issue to exist. Since other systems like Nest Wifi, Eero 3, and others don't often have a dedicated backhaul either I could imagine this would be a problem there too. It became clear to me that if I wanted to play stadia well (meaning running at 4K with no hiccups) from anywhere in the house I needed get hardwired connections to each of my wireless access points.

**My Options** 
I wasn't really interested (and nor was my wife) in seeing me put a bunch of holes in the walls to try and run multiple lines of ethernet from my switch in the basement up two stories to the attic and then run cables down interior walls to wire up ethernet ports. And I would imagine some of you may be in a similar situation. You know hardwired is what you want but running the wires is a massive or costly endeavor.

Enter MoCA...

I have tried powerline networking in the past and found it to be horribly inconsistent and still pretty slow. But I recently noticed that MoCA (Multimedia over coaxial) now has a 2.5 spec out which enabled 2.5Gbps over coax.  Since many homes built over the last 30 or so years have coax running through them to multiple rooms this turns out to be a great solution in those environments. The only caveat is that MoCA has notorious issues if you are already using those lines for satellite TV so buyer beware.

For me, the coax was completely unused in our house aside from getting internet from my ISP so I bought a couple of MoCA adapters for about $50 each. Hooked up a coax splitter to make sure the appropriate rooms were connected and bam! I was getting full Gigabit ethernet speeds with the same ping and 0 packet loss as other hardwired ethernet devices.

I of course immediately hooked up my CCU and fired up stadia in a room that was otherwise using the second mesh point over wifi and what a difference that made. Not only that but since the extended wifi points now had a hardwired ethernet backhaul the wifi was immediately better too.

**Conclusion** 
MoCA isn't a solution available to everyone but if you happen to have coax in a room where you get terrible wifi you should really consider it. I wanted to share this story in the hopes that it helps others with any home networking troubles. Even if you aren't using stadia but have multiple wifi points, giving each of those a hardwired connection back to the switch/router is an amazing improvement over normal wifi mesh.

With hardwired networking, Stadia works flawlessly and similarly so over a super solid 5Ghz connection with no other latency to the router.",,,,explanation,,,,

My PC is in a location where I can't run an ethernet cable to it from the router, but that has never been a problem.

&#x200B;

Wanted to see if anyone could perhaps provide some insight into a situation I've encountered since moving. This post may be pretty lengthy, so I apologize in advance, but this has been an ongoing issue and I am trying to be as thorough as possible in presenting the issues. If this is not the correct place to post, I apologize and will have it removed. My google-fu suggested this was my best go-to in terms of looking for suggestions and advice.

&#x200B;

My wife and I moved in with some friends in November of last year and have had issues throughout with our internet, specifically on my primary device, but with others as well. We have had and continue to have WiFi services provided to us by Spectrum (Time Warner/Charter/Bright House/etc.), for the record. The house that we live in is a three story historic home built in 1904; brick foundation, plaster walls - unsure about the remainder of the composition. We live on the third floor with one of our friends, while the other friend lives on the second floor. We have no access to the first floor and it is owned by another party who DOES NOT HAVE/utilize their own WiFi services. They are not using our WiFi services. Our WiFi is located on the second floor.

&#x200B;

Our trouble began when we moved in originally: we were noticing extremely poor connectivity and abysmal speeds. When it is not tax season, I typically work from home and have several calls routed through my desktop which is accessed using a work provided server. I initially setup a wired connection using a CAT5 cable and saw an improvement on speeds - but the plan we were currently paying for only provided a 50mbps download connection. With four people living in the home and using the WiFi, bandwidth became an issue quickly. Due to the onset of tax season I spent more time in the office than before, so I did not pursue the issue much previously. I do play video games through my desktop during downtime but due to the increase in workload it has not been a priority lately. We do not own cable and usually stream within the home and it seemed that with a wired connection to our SmartTV for a time that was sufficient.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the past two weeks: I had a somewhat unexpected surgery and as a result an extended amount of time off of work with the option to work a few additional days at home. Once I was on my feet and had the ample recovery time at my fingertips I attempted to play some online video games and the like off of my desktop but had terrible results. Trying to access anything through my works server usually resulted in a failed connection - I couldn't even check my email at the time. We had discussed updating our internet to a 1GB plan thru Spectrum previously and I decided that now would be a good time to go through with the upgrade.

&#x200B;

We went with the 1GB upgrade (960MBPS as listed by Spectrum), had a technician come out, install the hardware and run a connectivity test. I initially wanted the router and modem to be installed in my bedroom, directly opposite where my desktop/workstation is located, but the only location within the house that was eligible for hookup happened to be downstairs in the 2nd floor living room. Upon completion, the technician informed me that overall connectivity was bad all across the board so he went out to check on some potential problem sources that existed outside the home. After doing so, he believed that some of the equipment that the lines were connected to outside were old and in need of repair as well as having the meter levels reset. He put in a maintenance order for the same day, a team came out, and upon checking our connectivity later in the evening we saw no improvements. We were informed by a Spectrum team member that the work order had been completed.

&#x200B;

The following day, a new technician arrived and replaced both our modem and router (supplied by Spectrum), checked some wiring within the house and determined it was OK. He proceeded to check the external sources and determined the problem was the same as before: some sort of external issue was causing poor connectivity. The technician informed us that whoever had come out the day prior for the work order had done absolutely nothing. Once again, a new work order was placed, a team was dispatched and to my surprise upon checking our connectivity - nothing had changed, both on a wired and wireless connection.

&#x200B;

On the third day, another technician arrived and virtually replaced all of the wiring on the outside of the house that he was able to - cables in the basement were fixed, a new line was run outside the house, the meter levels were checked. Overall the technician spent somewhere around five hours at our house ensuring everything was working properly. Upon checking our speed levels both on a wired connection and wireless we found that our speeds were much better but not up to par on what we were paying for. His personal meter was maxing out around 680MBPS on download speeds (however it was wildly inconsistent, some readings as low as the mid 400's) and our own devices were in the high 100 to low 200MBPS download speeds on a wireless connection. My personal desktop, which was on a wired connection, would not pull a download speed higher than 180MBPS. Even weirder, the upload speeds were appearing exactly as advertised: high 30's to low 40MBPS on every test. The best explanation that the technician could provide us was that there were issues in how the speeds were distributed among residents (we live in a city), citing inadequate infrastructure in the surrounding area. His recommendation was to downgrade to the 400MBPS speed (until Spectrum could ensure that new fiber optic line had been laid in our area and that all of the external equipment was updated properly), which he was able to consistently pull on his meter and see if that had any effect on the situation.

&#x200B;

My first step after that technician left was to use my own equipment from my previous home and attempt to make the 1GB connection work. For speeds higher than 400MBPS, Spectrum does not allow you to use either your own modem or router for the time being, therefore the overall connection simply would not go through. I know that both my router and modem (ASUS/Motorola, respectively) can handle up to a 300MBPS connection as it is, so it made more sense to move forward with the downgrade anyway, I just wanted to see if there was an increase in consistency using my own equipment vs. theirs. After doing so, I attempted to run connectivity tests using my own equipment. No improvement over what he was observing the day prior. I then switched back to the equipment provided by Spectrum (I was on the phone with support throughout, having devices activated and deactivated - I'm sure they loved me) and again, same results. I tried switching Ethernet ports on each device, power cycling, the typical run down of 'fixes' tech support would offer you to no avail. I asked Spectrum to confirm that the two previous work orders had been completed, and they had, although the representative stated that according to each work order, the meter levels had not been changed at all on either visit. Without a clear picture in sight, Spectrum ordered another technician to come out the following day: this technician was one of their quality control technicians, the second highest technician in all the Spectrum land before a supervisor/engineers would start coming out.

&#x200B;

This technician showed up the following day, checked the outside wiring and meter settings (which he confirmed hadn't changed, nor did they need to be changed, hence why no work had been done the previous two visits), checked the inside wiring and then proceeded to run connectivity tests using his equipment. Each time he tested we were hitting the max speeds that came with the plan (the plan is advertised as 400MBPS but can reach speeds in the mid 500's) on the Spectrum provided router and modem. It was bizarre, almost as if all of the previous days issues had completely vanished. We tested a few devices downstairs wirelessly (no Ethernet ports available on the downstairs devices). We were hitting speeds in the mid to high 300's on each device, so in that regard things were working as intended. I understand that WiFi has difficulty traveling through certain material/housing compositions (and can be finicky in general as a wireless connection) so these speeds were to be expected with our plan when factoring in the age and composition of the home we lived in.

&#x200B;

When we went upstairs to test my desktop using a wide variety of speed tests (google fiber optic, speedtest by ookla, spectrum, AT&T, etc.) on a WIRED connection - same issue. Still hitting the high 100's in terms of MBPS/download speed. Removing the wired connection and running the tests wirelessly the problem got even worse - we were between 4 and 5MBPS download speed consistently. The idea that the CAT6 cable I was using for the wired connection came to mind so I had the technician inspect it by connecting to his own personal device and once again he was receiving consistent speeds in the mid 500's. He also tested the connection wirelessly using his personal cell phone and was seeing speeds in the mid 300's, similar to what we observed downstairs. So we agreed - it has to be hardware on the computer that is an issue at this point.

&#x200B;

That same day I took my computer to a local tech center that I've had a lot of luck with in the past. They took my computer in after I explained my issue more thoroughly than what is probably necessary and the technicians spent roughly 6 hours (their words) combing over any potential issues: motherboard, LAN card, etc. No issues to report. They ran their own connectivity tests and said the readings were coming in over 100MBPS which was higher than normal considering the number of devices connected to their in-center WiFi. There was no way for them to test connection speeds higher than a 100MBPS download unfortunately. I picked it back up the following day, spent some more time discussing potential issues with two additional technicians at the center, each with nothing to report. Just for fun, I bought another brand new CAT6 cable to test at home.

&#x200B;

So here I am today, at home, testing the network on the original CAT6 cable: 180MBPS, 135MBPS, 99.4MBPS, 151MBPS - all download speed results taken from different providers. Google indicated the fastest connection speed, whereas Spectrum indicated the lowest. I then went and replaced the previous CAT6 cable with the newest one I purchased and the speed tests are indicating almost identical speeds as those listed above. I ran a few speed tests on my phone while connected to the WiFi service and I am still getting higher readouts (mid to low 200's) than I am on my desktop with a wired connection. Again, old house, makes sense. I have attempted, once again to power cycle, change adapter ports for the cable itself, look for snags/kinks, etc. No improvements. The download speeds have remained consistently low (based on the plan) throughout. Additionally, I ran a few more wireless tests and have seen an improvement... not much of an improvement, but still one nonetheless with download speeds reading about 12MBPS consistently.

&#x200B;

I should note that the desktop in question that has been encountering the most problems was used with a wired 200MBPS connection five months ago (using a personally purchased modem and router) with no issue. Speeds consistently were seen to be at 200MBPS. Seven months ago, the same desktop was used once again with a wired 300MBPS connection (this time using both personally purchased equipment and Spectrum provided equipment for a short period) with yet again no issues. When we were on the 300MBPS plan, for some reason or another my desktop would connect fine and show consistent speeds with Spectrum's equipment, but our SmartTV would not - upon installing my own equipment (ASUS router/Motorola Modem) the issue disappeared completely. During the time I was using my own equipment, speed tests indicated higher download speeds than what we were paying for: we had, on average, roughly 340MBPS download speeds while only paying for 300. The computer was built just a little over nine months ago and was setup to be compatible with a 1GB connection. We had not planned on moving at the time and had been notified that higher plans would be available in our area the following year, hence the 'future proofing', if you will. The only maintenance that has occurred during this time frame (outside of general cleaning) was a new GPU and a new motherboard. Both of these pieces of hardware were installed during the time where we weren't experiencing any connectivity issues - everything was as it was supposed to be.

&#x200B;

As far as location goes (if that matters), I am based out of Covington, Kentucky. Previously I was living in two different suburbs to the north of Cincinnati, Ohio. The tests that I have been running each pull from a different server based in the United States:

1. speedtest by ookla is pulling from Lexington, KY (135MBPS download average)
2. Spectrum is pulling from Columbus, OH (99MBPS download average)
3. Google Fiber is pulling from Atlanta, GA (189MBPS download every time)
4. AT&T did not list a location (135MBPS download average)

&#x200B;

On speedtest by ookla, specifically, I have changed the server from Lexington, KY to Columbus, OH to match Spectrum's server and I am seeing a similar download speed in the 99MBPS range. To satisfy my own curiousity, I changed the server to Atlanta, GA (across a few different providers: [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net), comcast, etc.) as well to match Google Fibers server location and am seeing average speeds in the mid to high 60's. So there is definitely some inconsistency there.

&#x200B;

The CAT cables being used for the wired connection are both CAT6 cables, one being 50ft and the other being 75ft. The 50ft was sold as a CAT6 cable, whereas the 75ft was sold as a CAT6A. The 50ft cable is listed as a CAT6 RJ45 to CAT6 RJ45 9P8C (male to male) cable. Both are brand new, both purchased from separate retailers within the last week. I understand that overall wired connectivity can diminish at certain lengths, but if I understand correctly notable issues, specifically with DL/UL speeds, do not arise unless the cable is over 300 meters in length.

&#x200B;

SO, I am now completely out of ideas and am not sure how to move forward - is it an internet issue or is it a device issue? I'm just not sure how or where to proceed with the issue at this point in time. I do not have my personal laptop that does have an Ethernet port with me at this time, nor will I have it in the very near future, so I cannot plug it in to check and see how the connection performs wired in on other devices. From what I know, I am skeptical that it is a cable issue due to the fact that I have tried multiple cables at this point. The only thing that immediately stands out is that the cable that I was using for my previous connections some months back (at different locations when there were no issues) MAY have been a 25ft CAT5 cable, as opposed to a CAT6, but I do not know this for certain - it has simply been too long ago for that information to standout in my mind.

&#x200B;

That being said, the equipment currently being used is:

\-Hitron eMTA Modem

\-Sagemcom Router

\-inland 50ft CAT6 RJ45 cable

\-Ethernet or CAT6 cable is connected to Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller #2

\-Wireless is run via Qualcomm Atheros AR5BWB222 Wireless Network Adapter

&#x200B;

All equipment has been updated to their latest available drivers, no settings have been changed on the Desktop nor are there any that should prohibit 4-500MBPS download speeds on a wired connection. All tests today have been run with only the Desktop itself being an active, internet connected device, with the exception of one instance when I did power on my phone to see what speeds it was obtaining. Everything else has been shut off or removed at this time. Anything that I've forgotten or may be crucial to solving the issue, please let me know, I will do my best to provide what information I can. I am not extremely tech savvy, but I am open to learning and trying new things. The other devices in the home range that were used for testing (with the exception of cell phones) range from 4-6 years in age.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any guidance they can provide me with on how to move forward, I would greatly appreciate it. This issue has stumped me for the better part of a week. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read through this post. I know it is incredibly long, I just wanted to make sure I was thorough in explaining the situation and what has been tried throughout in the hopes of a fix.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - had new internet service installed, house completely rewired, desktop still not getting speeds being paid for by ISP on wired connection

&#x200B;

EDIT: Because I have used the desktop as a wired connection since it was built, I never took the time to bother with installing any antennas to the back end of my LAN card. I just went ahead and did just this; I took two antennas from my ASUS router that currently isn't in use and installed them on the back end. Now my wireless connection has increased considerably, I am seeing wireless download speeds anywhere from 40MBPS to 100MBPS. Of course, this still isn't a solution nor does it contribute to the desired outcome (I am trying to achieve stability and consistency) but it is indeed a noticeable improvement.

&#x200B;

EDIT2: Doing some additional digging, it seems I am finding that the Wireless Network Adapter is limited to 300MBPS connections. I do not know if this was an oversight on my part when building, or if it was something just accepted going off the understanding that I would be primarily using a wired connection. Wireless is too unstable to make any real deductions from this, but I thought it was worth mentioning anyway.

&#x200B;

EDIT3: Have tried hard wiring the connection directly into the modem at this time, speeds are the same if not a little bit slower. I really need to try moving the desktop downstairs or at least take it to a local Spectrum store to see what connection speeds I'm getting but due to my surgery I cannot lift it or move it for some time.

&#x200B;

EDIT4: Something interesting that I just discovered: the Ethernet port on the modem itself appears to be broken. There should be a latch (I guess you would call it?) on the modem itself that helps keep the Ethernet cable in place. That latch is missing, so the cable seems to come out or become disconnected pretty easily. I'm not sure how I didn't notice this before...but I'm also not sure if this can influence the connectivity issues either.  ",,,,explanation,complaint,slow internet,troubleshooting,

Iâ€™m moving into a new home next month and Iâ€™ve been eyeing the Eero pro 6 3 pack as Iâ€™d like to set up a mesh network given the house is just under 4,000 Sq ft with 3 floors. I want the Pro 6s and have the budget for them as I want to optimize and future proof. Also the speed tests videos Iâ€™ve been watching have been off the charts and thatâ€™s not even including Ethernet backhaul...just wireless.

I have this very strange fear going back to the mid 2000â€™s when I cycled through several POS Netgear and Arris routers. I had more trouble with those things than they were worth. I know a mesh network is obviously different than a router from 2008 but my fear stems from the notion of less is more.

Iâ€™ve been living in an apartment for the last 3 years and have had flawless internet with Fios. I have their newest router with WiFi 6 and Iâ€™m running 400mbps. I plan to get 1G for the new house. Everything with Fios and their router has been perfect. Not a single drop in 3 years other than a power outage. Pure perfect internet. 

Based on my perfect experience with Fios, Iâ€™m almost afraid that by adding more (the Eero Pro 6â€™s), it will somehow take me back to the days of the mid 2000s with drops several times a month.

437,"I've had some trouble keeping my homebase working consistently, so I built a workflow to display the following information at the tap of a button:

 - Network Provider (AT&T) & Connection Type (LTE, HSPA+, etc.)
 - General Signal (bar count && RSSI)
 - LTE Downlink (LTE RSRP)
 - The Cell ID & Location code for tower the homebase is connected to
 - The physical address of that tower


The workflow can also optionally run a short 10MB speed test via fast.com and report that.


Workflow link: https://workflow.is/workflows/6b27a1424d7b423f9a6ff78b05233a8b

This workflow only works with the 2nd generation ""ATT Wireless Internet"" version of the homebase ( https://www.zteusa.com/att-wirelessinternet ), as the first generation does not support querying the cell ID & location code, nor anything else that would be useful lol.


The only thing the workflow needs from you is a (free) OpenCelliD.org token to query the tower address. You can get one with just a name and email here: https://www.opencellid.org/


The workflow helped me figure out that my homebase would run like crap when it connected to a specific AT&T tower that, apparently, gets overloaded on weekends when the tourists arrive in town. A directional antenna aimed at a different tower sorted me out :)",,,,explanation,advice,,,
109,"First, I'm going to suggest that if you have technical questions like this, you should include the make/model(s) of the things that you are using to get your ""WiFi"", in this case modem, router, and even the device you are using to access the ""WiFi"" with, so that you can get a more accurate answer to your question.  10 year old router doesn't provide any actual usable info.

I am going to assume that by ""WiFi speed"" you actually mean internet speeds that you get via your WiFi router.

I'll try to keep it as simple as possible so that it's easier to understand, and I will leave out some ""stuff"" that doesn't apply to most basic and simple home internet setups like what I am guessing that you currently have.

OK, Internet comes to most homes/places via a medium (phone wires, coax cable, fiber optic, or RF (radio frequency) and the first thing it ""hits"" is a modem, this converts the signal that's coming from your ISP using a ""medium"" and then it's converted into something you can actually use, for the sake of argument let's call that WAN Ethernet.

Next that WAN Ethernet is connected to the input of a/the router.  The routers function is to ""share/split"" that one Ethernet connection (public IP address) in a way so that more than one device on your local network can access and us it.  The router usually uses DHCP to assign IP addresses to each local device connected to/on your local network and NAT so that it can keep track of what data that's both leaving and coming back from the ""internet"" and then route it to right local device. 

Devices connect to the router using a LAN (local) Ethernet port and/or WiFi, and by successfully using one of these two ways of connecting is how you actually get ""internet"" to your local device.  Most ""routers"" come with both LAN Ethernet ports and WiFi.

Now, both the modem and the router can be in the same ""box"" this would be a combo device (modem + router), this is what you typically get when you sign up with most ISPs (Internet Service Providers), and modem comes directly connected to the router, so then you will usually just see LAN ports, and of course there's the WiFi.

That's how your device connects to the ""internet"" in a nut-shell.

The actual speed of your internet mostly depends on the internet plan's speed but also can be affected by the modem and router.

A new router can boost your local network's WiFi speeds, but it cannot boost internet speeds, beyond what your internet plan provides.  If your internet plan speed is 25 Mbps (bandwidth) down, then that's the absolute fasted that one device on your network can get, if you have more than one device connected, then they can each get/access a part of that 25 Mbps, so the more devices/users there are on the local network using/access internet, the less there is to go around, so it will appear ""slow"" to the individual users.  The modem might be putting out 25 Mbps, but with enough users, everyone eventually ends up not getting enough.

Streaming media and video really puts the ""hurt"" on the internet connection, since depending on ""resolution"" selected and the bandwidth requirements of that ""resolution"" it can eat into the internet plans bandwidth, and once there isn't ""enough"" to support everyone using internet in the ""house"", things slow to a crawl, and media starts ""buffering"" as a way/means to try to deal with the lack of bandwidth.


So, getting a new router may help if the ISP plan speed is faster than what the old router's WiFi can support.

     If you have an internet plan with 25 Mbps down, then a new router can only share that 25 Mbps between all the clients/users attached to the router.  The WiFi can be made faster with a new router, but that alone won't increase the internet speeds beyond your plan speeds.

     On the other hand if you have a internet plan that's faster than what your router/WiFi can support, then a new router can definitely make a difference.  For example if you go with a plan that has speeds in excess of 100 Mbps, and your modem and/or router can only support 10/100 Ethernet on the WAN port, then the ""fastest"" internet you can get is usually limited to around 100 Mbps.  The only exception is if you have a combo device, then it may be able to provide faster than 100 Mbps WiFi to connected devices if the router's WiFi and the connected devices (client) WiFi are both able to support speed faster than 100 Mbps.  This used to be a pretty common thing back in the day, when 1000 Gbps (1 GbE) Ethernet first came out and wasn't a ""consumer"" level product yet.  The slowest ""connection"" that you have in the modem, router, device chain will determine the max speed that can be pushed through the entire chain of devices.

Now, a new WiFi router that supports 802.11ac will tend to have better range and also WIFi speeds, especially if you have devices that support 802.11ac.

But in most cases you would need a sufficiently fast internet plan in order to resolve the type of issues that you seem to be having.

If you have a modem, and a separate router, then it should not be a difficult thing to swap out the router.  You should check your ISP's web pages to see their instructions for how to swap or set up your own router.

If you have a combo device it's a bit more difficult, but it can still be done, you should look into putting the combo device into ""bridge"" mode and deactivating the built in WiFi, so that the new router can take over the DHCP and NAT functions, as well as being the only WiFi source that you can connect to.  Again, your ISP's web page or you can use Google to find out more about this and the how to.  The goal is to avoid ending up with a double-NAT configuration, because that can cause problems, if it is not something want, if you don't know what it is, and how to use or work around one.

Check your internet plan's speed, and then try doing a speed test with only one device connected and using the internet.  If you do a speed test with other devices still connected, then you are going to see the speed that your device is able to get, while competing with the other users/devices.

To recap, a new router by itself isn't likely to bee the answer to your issues, you first need to know what you internet plan speed is, and you might have to start with a internet plan upgrade.

However if your plan speed is actually more than fast enough, then you may have another problem/issue and that could be inside your house or could be an issue between the modem and the ISP's equipment.  But with the info provided, I really cannot even try to take a guess.

Hope this made sense and was helpful.

We moved to a new office across town with a new internet provider. When we first moved we only had WiFi as none of the ethernet cords had been run yet. No problem, my desktop connects to WIFI. My accounting software ran bananas slow but everything else seemed to work okay. Then a few days later they ran the ethernet cables and hardwired us all in. Everybody else has had no issues but my computer has slowed down immensely.... Adobe takes minutes to open instead of seconds, Mozilla Firefox loads pages so slow and often stops responding, same issue with excel and word, videos on Reddit and Facebook won't play anymore and my monitor speakers stopped working (???). In fact the only program that is running fine is the accounting software now. It's very frustrating especially since everything was fine before the move and no one else in the office is having problems. I tried uninstalling random apps and programs I don't use, cleaned up my disk space, cleared my internet history, disabled Microsoft's random start ups, de fragged(?) the hard drive, updated Adobe, ran a virus scan with our security program and I turn it off every night so it's been restarted.

The 600 mbps thing is odd, if you're all wired backhaul you should be seeing speeds around 900-950 mbps testing wired connections regardless of being wired into the gateway or a wired backhaul leaf node.  Unless you're seeing 600 mbps testing over Wi-fi from a wired leaf node, in which case that's not really unexpected.

Typically if ethernet cable or switch port is an issue you'll see fallback to 100 mbps fast ethernet, though degradation in throughput without that happening is possible I suppose.

You don't mention your topology but I assume it's correct.  SQM if it's enabled can also chop-off upper bound throughput in speed tests.  All speedtest servers are also not created equal, so try at least a couple.

If it went bad already from just weather. HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE MOVED AROUND FOR RV?   And the proprietary design of the cable means we cant just pop out to best buy and pickup a new one real fast. we have to wait weeks or months to get one while paying for a service that we cant even get anyone to answer.

My last issue i the road to happiness has been that since I got the motherboard, my internet speeds went from 600/600Mbps up/down (real speeds) to 350/25Mbps up/down. WTF.

So, I googled the hell out of the problem, searched for ""new motherboard internet speeds slow"" and sat through a few annoying-as-hell Youtube videos promising they had a fix and tweaked every setting I could find in both the BIOS but mainly in the network adapter settings. Nothing worked.

So, I had a quick thought and checked in MSI  Dragon Center and lo and behold... there is something sadistically titled ""LAN Manager"". I can only assume that LAN Manager translates to ""\*\*\*\*  you and your internet speeds"" in Taiwanese.

Upon disabling the ""LAN Manager"", all of a sudden the clouds parted, a ray of sunshine broke through the clouds in my bedroom and a deep voice, echoed with choirs of angels, said: ""And thus was your internet speed returned to thee"". A speed test shows I am back at 600/600Mbps.

Seriously, I am sick of companies putting out terrible software to control every facet of your PC and enabling every option by default, especially with things as sensitive and important as your internet speed. Installing MSI Dragon Center took a badass wolf of a connection and turned it into a Chihuahua because... umm... I have no god damn idea why.

This issue happens specifically every Wednesday from 6-10 pm.

I have run speed tests through Ookla and Google and do a dummy stream to restream every morning for the past 2 weeks and it's perfectly fine. Once we try to go live on Wednesday nights it refuses to establish a connection greater than 700kb/s - even when speed tests show that I have 20mbps+ upstream speeds.

I now have upgraded to Cox Gigablast (gigabit internet package) which should provide \~1000 mbps down and \~40 mbps up.

THE WORST PART IS: we have to stream from my iphone as a hotspot that is provided by work every week, which consistently provides me 2000 - 4000 kb/s, so thank god for unlimited data. Obviously this is not sustainable nor scalable.

We've done a bajillion things (no splitters, fresh coax direct to modem, tried 2 different modems, bypassed my router, fresh CAT6 cable to a known good PC with a gigabit network card.

Sounds like its a problem at the CMTS for me, but it couldn't be any number of things for you or me.

If I were you I would use their chat function instead of phone call, and then when you do get a tech to come out spend the time to talk to them about a plan AND if you can, get their business card.

In problems like this the best troubleshooting technique is (roughly) as follows:

1. Make sure it isn't the customer's equipment (Comcast should handle this by bringing a speed tester or a testing modem to your house. If they don't do this they aren't working efficiently.) You've already done part of them for them by connecting directly to the modem with an ethernet cable (note: get a new CAT6 cable from monoprice online, they're cheap and cables CAN be a huge source of problems.. so just get a new one to be sure.)

2. Make sure it isn't the customer's wiring (In my case we noticed my coax cable running in the basement was brittle and had one part that looked ripped/worn. We replaced all the coax in about 10 minutes. The technician then tested signal quality at the modem, at the end of the coax disconnected from the modem, and then outside behind my house where the coax comes inside. They then went and tested further upstream in their line.

3. Make sure it isn't a misconfiguration. The techician should check to make sure there are no errors on Comcast's side with your account settings (ie, if you have gigabit service it should show gigabit service in your account.) Additionally, the technician should make sure the correct boot file is being sent to your modem.

If they come on site and you see that they're doing something similar to this I'd let them go about their work, if they come in and act clueless ask them if they've tried these things, and if they haven't tried all of them--why not?

Hello

I hope someone here can help me out here. I got Spectrum internet 400mbps service and I use their modem (just modem Not router). I have this modem connected to a PFSense computer as my main Router/Firewall. This have different VLANS and other settings, (nothing crazy and nothing for bandwidth control yet). From this PFsense it goes directly to a Cisco switch 3560 with the VLANs configured (without any speed control on any VLAN). I have a few items connected to this switch(another Switch 3560,  Dell Server running Hyper-V with few VMs, , One Plex Server, Alarm Web Interface controller, three physical computers and three TP Link Access point EA225 (these Aps are AC MIMO). There are all connected using Cat 6 Cable to cover my entire house. This APs is Controlled by the Omada Controller running in a Virtual computer inside the Server.

Everything is working (good signal, and all well communicating) my issue is the speed on the wireless connection devices. (TVs, Android Box, Tablet, Mobile phones, etc ). If I run a speed test on any computer connected wired, or any of the VMs, it gives me between 380mpbs and 390mpbs. PERFECT! Now the issue is that if I run a speed on any wireless device it goes up 80Mbps, (70mbps and 80mbps).

So, I check few things, the controller settings for the Wireless Access points. The PFSense Settings, and nothing it seems to be blocking the speed. The funny part is, if I disconnect one of the AP and connect a laptop to the same port and run a speed test, it goes again to 370+mbps, if I connect the AP back in the same port and run the speed test on the same laptop connected wireless drop to around 70mbps.

So, I thought maybe was the AP. I change the AP to a new one, and the result is the same. I connect a TPLink Deco P9 Mesh, I am selling now (since I purchase the roof 225 Aps) and it gives me the same results with the Mesh.

I honestly out of ideas. Because I am getting the speed on my house. So I cant say is the ISP. But only getting it to the wired connected device only. So 80mbps is not so bad, but I would like to enjoy the 400mbps I am paying for (or at least close) so when everyone is watching Netflix have enough bandwidth.

I know I am not going to get the full 400 on wireless, but it is possible that cut the speed from 400 to 70mbps?

Any suggestion where or how to check I appreciated",,,,isp,slow internet,troubleshooting,,

&#x200B;

I've never hosted any internet service before but wanted to establish a simple, personal FTP server to move files between my family and friends. I had done this in the past using the IIS utility in Windows 10 to setup an FTP server but I hadn't used it in months so I tried getting it working again to no avail. My previous FTP site was not allowing any connections from my local machine or my laptop on the same network. I checked [guides online](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-and-manage-ftp-server-windows-10) that had helped me build the site initially and all my settings were the same. I checked my port forwarding and my internal IP had changed so I re-forwarded my ports and established a static IP address. My FTP site is still refusing connections from both my local machine and my laptop.

&#x200B;

I tried deleting the FTP site and starting from scratch following the guide again, still resulted in not being able to connect.  When connecting to ""[ftp://127.0.0.1](ftp://127.0.0.1)"" or ""[ftp://localhost](ftp://localhost)"" in Google Chrome I get the error ""This site can't be reached"" and when I connect to the same addresses in Windows Explorer I get ""Windows cannot access this folder. Make sure you typed the file name correctly and that you have permission to access the folder.""

&#x200B;

To make sure it was not something wrong in my method of connection I connected to the public FTP site [ftp://speedtest.tele2.net](ftp://speedtest.tele2.net) and this connection works fine in Windows Explorer.

&#x200B;

I wanted to double check my server was binding port 21 properly so I run netstat and see the process on port 21, I can turn off my FTP Site in ISS and netstat no longer shows the port in use until I restart it.

&#x200B;

I've allowed FTP in Windows Firewall and also attempted with the firewall turned off. No luck.

84,"I recently moved into a new house with my wife, and purchased a 40Mbps internet plan.  For the past few days my overall connection has been alright, however I noticed sometimes my ping would randomly skyrocket and even have some packet loss.  After some testing I realized it was my ping to my modem that would suddenly go to 300+ms for a few moments.  I assumed maybe I was in a bad spot for wifi reception, so I wired my computer to the modem and still noticed the same problem.  It happens sporadically so I'm not sure how I'd be able to replicate the issue.  It still would happen after restarting the modem. 

Alongside this, I started running some speed tests (using google's and speedtest.net) and am noticing download speeds anywhere from 9-12Mbps, much lower than my supposed 40.  I can understand being slightly slower during peak hours but that seems excessive.  What's worse is my modem GUI has a ""connection speed"" reading that states 43646Kbps down and 5501 up, but it always reads this exact number all the time so I'm wondering if it's actually just supposed to be a readout of your maximum.  I took a few screenshots [here](http://imgur.com/a/1SMmY).  One was taken during what I assume are peak hours (evening, around 6pm) and one was taken at around midnight.  These speed tests were done after resetting my modem and giving it ample time to boot back up, and turning off all other devices that would otherwise be connected.  My computer was physically wired to the modem when I ran these tests as well. 

I'm mostly curious if there's any other preparation I should do before calling my ISP and getting them to have a technician come out and help.  I've heard stories of technicians not really being much help by saying they ""can't find anything wrong,"" and I'm afraid that they will simply look at the ""speed readout"" under my modem GUI and only go by that number. 

Is there any other evidence I can stack in my favor before calling my ISP?  I want to have as many bullets in my gun as possible before having them send a technician.  I'm not horribly network-savvy but I'd like to think I'm more knowledgeable than the average person.

579,"Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for me, as it is driving me mad. I recently moved into a new house where I could have Fibre To The Premises (FTTP). As a Network engineer in the UK this was brilliant, as most of us are still on crappy internet. Anyway I have \~330/50 Mbps here over fibre. I recently got given a bunch of Unify equipment that was about to be thrown in the bin from a client, this included a Security Gateway Pro 4, a handful of AP Pro's and a Cloud Key (Gen 1).

I got it all setup today, and was pleased at how quick and easy it all seemed. I have two networks on seperate VLAN's, two SSID's, one for each network. The second network is for smart devices such as Ring Doorbell that I do not wish to have on the same network as everything else. Security Gateway Pro is connected to an 8 Port Zyxel Managed gigabit PoE switch, connected to 3 AP's, Cloud Key and Xbox.

Straight away all our devices connected without issues, wireless coverage is great and the speeds are brilliant, very happy.

However my xbox one X is being a pain! Straight away I had issues, i believe because UPnP was disabled. Not a problem, I left it off and manually forwarded the ports to the Xbox through the router. This resolved the NAT Type errors on the Xbox. But my downloads are going incredibly slow! As far as I can notice, online games are working fine. (I am mostly playing rocket league at the moment). If I go into all of the network settings in Xbox menu it shows 'everything is good' and the built in speed test on the Xbox shows speeds of over 300 Mbps/48 Mbps. But my downloads are hovering around 1 Mbps mark, and keep stopping and starting. If I connect up the old BT Smart Hub Router, they jump straight back up to above 250 Mbps download speed.

I can't figure out what would be causing this, IPD/IDS are both disabled, there is no QoS / Bandwidth limiting applied (unless any is on as standard and I haven't found it!).

Anyway, if anyone has experienced a similar problem and has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

For reference, I'm a certified Meraki/Zyxel/Ruckus Network Engineer, and Mitel Certified Telephone System engineer so feel free to throw tech-terms at me. However this is my VERY first experience with any Unifi equipment, so I may just be doing something stupid!

Thanks!

Also going to leave this here as it's nice to show of some bandwidth after putting up with \~18 Mbps / 1 Mbps for so long!

258,"Hello, just looking for some help here on a very specific scenario. I'm currently living in a condo in downtown Toronto with Gigabit fibre internet unlimited bandwidth from Bell.

To preface the issue before I paint the picture, my internet cuts out briefly (like for 1 minute) before getting restored. I've realized this only happens in a very specific scenario - only when playing an online video game while watching something (sports, TV show, movie, etc.) on my second monitor simultaneously. I'm usually on Discord as I'm playing with my friends during this time, and some times might even go as far as streaming what I'm watching (through Discord) so my friends can all watch along. It varies, but usually within the next 10 - 20 minutes, my internet gets disconnected, as evident by my game losing connection, my stream freezing, and my Discord voice chat no longer working. My desktop also pops up a notification saying I lost internet connection. It then comes back after like a minute, but I just close everything other than my game and Discord so I'm not affected moving forward.

I would also like to mention that this happens when I'm downloading games on Steam. I'm not even doing any demanding multitasking this time around. It happens even when I'm just on Discord chatting but my internet will again pop in and out and the download will never be smooth.

I've never had these issues before moving to my current place, even when I was with Rogers on a slower internet speed. I can confirm it's not my internet speed because I have a CAT6 and CAT8 cable and tested both using an online internet speed test, and both results came in with negligible differences (\~940 download, \~450 upload).

Is this Bell throttling my internet because I'm demanding too much bandwidth? If so, is there something I can do on my end to prevent this from happening or should I give Bell a call? Or is this a computer issue (I highly doubt it though as this wasn't an issue before moving to my current place).

Even  as we bought the new switches, and i fresh reinstalled the computers,  Fortnite is still stuttering/lagging and generally performes worse than  before.

The specs of the computers are as follows:

11 computers with Windows 10 Pro x64,  i5-6500 @ 3.20 GHz, GTX 750ti and 8 GB RAM

4 computers with Windows 7 Ultimate x64,i5-7400 @ 3.00 GHz GTX 1050ti and  8 GB RAM

Here are is an Ookla speed test result:

&#x200B;

Ookla Speedtest Results

Ever  since that , even with that result, when i download something on any  computer on the network, Fortnite show that it's lost internet  connection.

Before we bought the new switches, Fortnite was showing up to 32% packet loss, but  that was happening only to Fortnite.

Since we bought the new switches, the packet loss stopped, only losing a packet every 2-300.

But still when i donload something the game starts to freeze/stutter/lag.

That  is happening to Fortnite only, every other game is performing as it  should, exept Path of Exile, but i thing that's unrelated.

When i  ping in cmd,

ping facebook.com -t -l 50000 usually i get 59 ms, but for some reason today it's showing that it cannot connect to the server

&#x200B;

CMD result

[CMD test result](https://preview.redd.it/018mpb0omn831.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=8204c1f156991c46261cdd697779b4ca3a2a3b8f)

Altough  i write this from the same pc that the CMD test was preformed, i can  connect to facebook, and every other website, CMD shows opposite.

We have an online radio, that sometimes stops completely when something is being downloaded.

I think the problem lies somewhere on the network but i cannot fix it, as i am not very schooled in dealing with such problems.

On the network we have 25 computers, split on to 3 gigabit switches

The main switch handles the main server pc, and 5 more,

The first secondary switch handles 11 pcs,

The second secondary switch handles 8 pcs.

On  the main server we have specialised software for running the whole  network, wich enbales and disables the computers for limited, specifed  on the server, time.

That program  disables the windows explorer.exe and injects its own GUI to run the  computers. I won't be able to provide links to the software, because  it's bought and modified afterwards.

Any and all help and further questions for providing help, are very appreciated.

414,"My ISPs cable modem has a software issue that causes its ethernet port for some customers to max out at 100mbps, ie it doesnt establish a 1000mpbs connection.  Since i'm getting cca 80/20 eero speed test speeds on a 200/20 connection, i am suspecting that's my case.  I have been trying to get this info from eero support, what speed ethernet link was my eero able to establish, but after three tries (three times back and forth with eero support), i still didn't get the answer.  I've tried to ask differently / rephrase, and i'm still getting ""the runaround"". So my question here is for someone at eero, does support even have this info available? I'd assume so, but given the lack of answer..  I'm attaching my most recent (third) attempt at asking the question, and the response i got:

My question (in response to two previous attempts at asking the same thing):  ""I know my cable. I am just not sure if the modem is providing a proper 1gig connection to the eero. Not to the internet, but just between the modem and the eero. Is it possible to see in your diagnostic data whether the eero established a 100 or 1000 mbps link on its WAN port? ""

Their answer (i am on purpose not exposing the agent's name):  ""With our tools we are able to help track the current performance of the network including the speed. This, along with the type of ethernet cable and the range of speeds offered by the internet service provider help to get a better idea of the situation. The tests we run donâ€™t gauge the full capacity of the connection, but rather the current options. What I can also say is that with an ethernet connection to devices you can get up to 1 Gbps while with wireless you can get up to 300 Mbps at 2.4 GHz and 867 Mbps at 5 GHz. If you have any other questions, don't be afraid to ask as I would be happy to help.""",,,,isp,slow internet,troubleshooting,tech support,

141,"A few tips I experienced when moving here and having Comcast:

Be tenacious about getting the service you pay for. If you aren't getting it call back often. Comcast has higher tiers of representatives. I got to the point where I would tell the first representative that I went through all of the initial steps and I wanted to talk to the next tier. Do not let up. They have to give you what you pay for.

From what I understand they are responsible for the line that makes it to your modem. I had a technician out 3 times until they finally figured out there was a spot that was having signal loss and they fixed the issue.

Maybe temporarily consider renting their equipment as well. I gave up on my own setup and rented theirs. I think having their equipment made it so they couldn't blame issues on anything else besides their service. Now I just monitor when they have new equipment releases and I get a new router/ modem combo every couple years for ""free."" I even had a lightning strike fry my equipment and they swapped it out for free. It's not as cost effective but now they have zero excuse to not fix my shit.

When doing an internet speed test use a different carrier other than speedtest which is owned by Comcast. Try the free charter or spectrum or other test sites to see if you're truly getting what you pay for.

I also went through this process for our union break room where I work. After 6 months of complaining they finally replaced over 250ft of cable for free and our internet works flawlessly. Do not let up!!",,,,isp,advice,,,

TL;DR when my USG is reset/powers up, it has stupid slow speeds on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net). However, after many hours, it eventually fixes itself to get back to normal speeds.

I am just a more knowledgeable than average tech consumer, not a pro by any means. I recently changed from an Edgerouter X SFP to a USG to ""unifi"" my whole system. I had to do some harder-than-needed bridge moding in my AT&T Pace router so that data would pass straight through without any firewall logic. I did this before for my Edgerouter, so nothing new to me. First power on, I adopted into my network and the speeds were slow. 5-25 Mbps in my 100 Mbps fiber/dsl. Mysteriously after several hours, the speeds eventually reached back into the 90's. Fine, maybe a first set up issue to get used to the modem or something.

However, I've had to power cycle the USG a couple times since for some cable management and network organization. Each time, the initial internet speeds are slow for hours, then eventually get back to normal speeds. I can deal with this for the rare occasion I will need to power cycle, but I'm really just trying to understand what is happening in the background inside the USG that slows the speeds initially. I don't do anything to the settings afterwards, but I continually to speed test. Hours later, mysteriously the speeds eventually get back up. It happens in a couple noticeable stages, first 5-25Mbps, the it goes up to 30-50Mbps, finally it goes to full speed at 90+. Yes, all wired tests, no major traffic happening while testing, same test source to keep consistency.

297,"Itâ€™s pretty much because the reported speed is somewhat misleading.  800mbit is the PHY rate, or layer 1 speed - essentially the raw speed that the underlying chipset is sending RF data.  Itâ€™s measured as if it were a full duplex connection, and it isnâ€™t - it can only transmit or receive, not both at once, so youâ€™ll generally see at most half of the PHY speed.

For standard 802.11, every frame (or combination of a handful of frames) needs an ACK (acknowledgement) frame so that it knows that the other end received it.  The transmitting side will wait a certain amount of time (ACK timeout) before sending it again.  This all happens many times per second but is also a big piece of what makes up the difference in speed.

Alternative MAC-level protocols (like Ubiquitiâ€™s AirMax or Mikrotikâ€™s NV2) can get around this issue by using TDMA (essentially syncing clocks and using timeslots instead of ACK), which helps in situations where you have a lot of subscribers on an AP and some are much further away than others.  But itâ€™s still half duplex so youâ€™ll never get anywhere near the full PHY rate.

The speed that youâ€™re measuring with a speed test is also the layer 7 speed, which has overhead for the MAC layer, IP, TCP, probably HTTP, etc in it.  The overhead of all of that makes a difference as well.

edit: Just noticed you asked for a less technical explanation.  ELI5 version is that your phone and router both need to talk to each other, but they canâ€™t talk at the same time or itâ€™ll be gibberish - so they take turns waiting.   The time they spend talking and waiting to talk works out to be roughly 50/50 - even if one side has nothing to say.

You absolutely can use remote play with your PS4 not plugged in to the TV via HDMI.  Just keep it in rest mode and it will be ready to go when you are.

I feel my PS4 Pro does have slightly better performance with Remote Play, but Iâ€™d rather use a base PS4 with an Ethernet cord than a Pro using WiFi.  If you arenâ€™t going to have the PS4 plugged in to the TV, Iâ€™d recommend putting it by the router and using a wired internet connection- makes a huge difference.


Regarding internet speed- if youâ€™re playing at home the connection only has to do with your router, so if you have a decent router youâ€™ll have a great connection.  When youâ€™re away from home and using internet for remote play the speed to look at for your home connection is upload speed (you can just google â€˜speed testâ€™ and run a diagnostic).  Likewise the download speed would matter in the place where you have the vita.  If either isnâ€™t up to snuff youâ€™ll have some issues.",,,,advice,tech support,,,
275,"I have two 1 gigabit internet connections, wired with not a single other device on the network i've never seen my ps4 or pro higher than 260mbÂ±10mb, and those are completely rare, non-repeatable speeds.

My xbox one's have been over 600mbps, but average around 450. My comps get high 600's.

Sony does have crap network infrastructure(so it's lucky all their best games are single player), and I was convinced the ethernet and wifi cards in the consoles were purchased in bulk on wish.
Their speed test is also so fast, it's hard to really get an accurate picture of consistent speed.

Fortunately, sony went to microsoft to handle their network infrastructure for ps5(ms is a big company, their azure cloud department has nothing to do with xbox so they don't care who's buying their service).

The best solution is to use ethernet, and have your router demilitarized zone set to your ps4(also helps if you set your ps4 ip manually when doing this). If your router is too far for ethernet, look into ethernet over phone or electrical outlets. Mesh wifi is even worse than regular wifi for game play, even if downloads are alright",,,,gaming,slow internet,advice,,

1. Did you run those speed tests while connected to the VPN?

I believe the issues would be network related or issues with the drive. I would try copying a large file to the drive then copy it back to your computer and see what transfer speeds you get.

Past that you would need to know the external IP of the server the drive is hosted on so you can do some ping tests to that external IP from your remote location.  If you can find that external IP info out then in command prompt you can do ""ping 0.0.0.0 -t"" (replace 0.0.0.0 with IP) and let it run to see what the latency/ping times are in MS and also if any packets drop.",,,,advice,tech support,,,

Try using the [Speedtest.net desktop app](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/desktop), let it auto-pick the server, and run the test.

288,"Hello boys and girls!
I've been thinking lately that maybe developers of games with online multiplayer part should start listing what kind of internet speed they expect players to have. I just downloaded this weekend little bit over 100 GB of Gears of War 4 to check it out, and although it took a while, it took less than an hour.

 
Why I'm thinking this should be a thing? Well, whenever I see people complaining about having to download IDK 12 GB of patch or DLC etc, for a multiplayer shooter, then I'm wondering what kind of connection they're using - and if they're using something slow, should they be restricted in ways to play the game ? I mean, are we are expecting developers to design game's netcode for people who have let's say 200 mbits and someone in rural australia with 3-8 mbit ? Because I'm thinking it's kind of impossible. One would always be lagging a lot, and probably experience a lot of lost packets etc. 


Granted, some games don't require lighting fast reflex and game's action aren't measured in miliseconds, so that wouln't matter. But then when I experience lags/netcode issues in games like Titanfall 2, Quake Champs etc even on [this kind of connection](http://beta.speedtest.net/result/6371276810.png), then I'm starting to think that why should my experience be hampered if I invested in proper PC and ISP but have to play with people who first of all should be playing in their region (Asia in Asia, not in Europe for example), and then have to face the fact, that their connection is too slow. 


What do you guys think? 

 
EDIT: Just to clarify - maybe not require as in game wouldn't run, but post an information of what developer expects you to use as internet connection in order to experience game properly.

EDIT2: What I had in mind is of course latency, and ping in game. Back in the old days servers for competitive shooters had ping limits for this very reason. ",,,,gaming,,,,

>What firmware is the AP on? That's a big question.

I updated it to the latest version earlier tonight (4.3.28.11361), but it's made no difference to the speed. 


>Channel should be 1,6,11 width 20mhz and power should be low

I've just reset the 2.4GHz but using channel 11 rather than 1, and I'm back to 180Mbps on the phone after it decided to start playing up earlier. I haven't got the option to go to 160 for the 5GHz channel width, just 20, 40, and 80 


>Check your phone as well (latest firmware / updates) from looking at the tech specs it's a WiFi 6 enabled radio, however, it's probably a 1x1 or 2x2 so you may not see the full wifi 6 standards in speed.

If I connect directly to my router I get the full 300+Mbps, and my laptop gets 300+Mbps on the router and AP, so I'm pretty confident that I can rule the phone itself out.

&#x200B;

>Regarding ISP speedtests and speedtests across the WAN. While they can be good measurements and indicative of issues they are unreliable for true throughputs due to internet congestion, latency, loads on the remote servers.

True, but I consistently get 300 - 320Mbps from everything connected to the router (assuming it's not a lower speed device, of course), and I get the same with my laptop from the AP. Other than the new issues that started tonight while I've been changing settings, I've been getting a consistent 190Mbps from the AP on my phone.

161,"Speedtest isnâ€™t wrong, itâ€™s just using different servers than fast. Fast uses Netflix servers, which may mean a couple of things - potentially, your results to them are faster, because theyâ€™re peered in a data center your ISP also uses. This means you may be able to get a connection to Netflix before going out to the wider internet.

Also potentially, your ISP could be throttling Netflix to 10mbps to lower bandwidth. Netflix makes up a lot of internet traffic since streaming video is somewhat bandwidth heavy, so some ISPs (especially mobile phones - here in the US, all of the big 3.5 cell carriers do this) throttle Netflix to a lower speed than the rest of the internet.

You can use different servers on speedtest to check different areas, just be aware of priority / QoS manipulation from your ISP.",,,,advice,tech support,,,

468,"Hi all,

&nbsp;

I have a very strange problem and I am not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I have a 1000/100 internet connection which can be achieved on every wired device on my LAN, apart from Proxmox. The LAN speeds are fine, I have run multiple iperfs between Proxmox and different machines and all tests are transferring at gigabit speeds. When I run speedtest however, I'm lucky if I hit 400Mbps on the download - most of the time it is around 100Mbps. The strange thing is, I cannot achieve gigabit internet speeds on the proxmox host, but if I reboot one of the guests and immediately perform a speedtest on said guest then I can hit the full 1000/100. And then if I run it again after, it drops back down to around 100/10. If I change a network setting using ethtool, and then run speedtest it will jump back up to gigabit but then drop back down on the second test. I have never experienced behaviour like this before. And yet, my local speeds are completely unaffected.

&nbsp;

The NIC used by proxmox according to lspci is Intel Corporation I350 Gigabit Network Connection. The version of Proxmox I am running is 7.1-10. I'm not sure what information to post that would be useful so please let me know.
